However, since information sources can contain errors, there exists an additional need to verify whether the information is correct. For this purpose, we hosted the first Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) shared task to raise interest in and awareness of the task of automatic information verificationa research domain that is orthogonal to information extraction. This shared task required participants to develop systems to predict the veracity of human-generated textual claims against textual evidence to be retrieved from Wikipedia.\nWe constructed a purpose-built dataset for this task (Thorne et al., 2018) that contains 185,445 human-generated claims, manually verified against the introductory sections of Wikipedia pages and labeled as SUPPORTED, REFUTED or NOTENOUGHINFO. The claims were generated by paraphrasing facts from Wikipedia and mutating them in a variety of ways, some of which were meaning-altering. For each claim, and without the knowledge of where the claim was generated from, annotators selected evidence in the form of sentences from Wikipedia to justify the labeling of the claim.\nThe systems participating in the FEVER shared task were required to label claims with the correct class and also return the sentence(s) forming the necessary evidence for the assigned label. Performing well at this task requires both identifying relevant evidence and reasoning correctly with respect to the claim. A key difference between this task and other textual entailment and natural language inference tasks (Dagan et al., 2009;Bowman et al., 2015) is the need to identify the evidence from a large textual corpus. Furthermore, in comparison to large-scale question answering tasks (Chen et al., 2017), systems must reason about information that is not present in the claim. We hope that research in these fields will be stimulated by the challenges present in FEVER.\nOne of the limitations of using human annotators to identify correct evidence when constructing the dataset was the trade-off between annotation velocity and evidence recall (Thorne et al., 2018). Evidence selected by annotators was often incomplete. As part of the FEVER shared task, any evidence retrieved by participating systems that was not contained in the original dataset was annotated and used to augment the evidence in the test set.\nIn this paper, we present a short description of the task and dataset, present a summary of the submissions and the leader board, and highlight future research directions.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Task Description", "text": "Candidate systems for the FEVER shared task were given a sentence of unknown veracity called a claim.

The primary scoring metric for the task is the label accuracy conditioned on providing at least one complete set of evidence, referred to as the FEVER score. Sentences labeled (correctly) as NOTENOUGHINFO do not require evidence. Correctly labeled claims with no or only partial evidence received no points for the FEVER score.\nWhere multiple sets of evidence was annotated in the data, only one set was required for the claim to be considered correct for the FEVER score.\nSince the development and evaluation data splits are balanced, random baseline label accuracy ignoring the requirement for evidence is 33.33%. This performance level can also be achieved for the FEVER score by predicting NOTENOUGHINFO for every claim. However, as the FEVER score requires evidence for SUP-PORTED and REFUTED claims, a random baseline is expected to score lower on this metric.\nWe provide an open-source release of the scoring software. 2 Beyond the FEVER score, it computes precision, recall, F 1 , and label accuracy to provide diagnostic information.
