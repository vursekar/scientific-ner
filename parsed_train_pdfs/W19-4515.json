We surveyed the literature for previously proposed schemes for rhetorical elements and present an overview of its current state of the art. We also searched for available tools using these schemes and applied four tools for our particular task of ranking biomedical abstracts based on text similarity. Comparison of the tools with two strong baselines shows that the predictions provided by the ArguminSci tool can support our use case of mining alternative methods for animal experiments.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "We aim to mine alternative methods to animal experiments from the biomedical literature. These are methods that address any of the so-called 3R principles of replacement (no animals at all or use of invertebrates over vertebrates), reduce (use of less animals), or refinement (cause less harm to animals) (Gruber and Hartung, 2004;Doke and Dhawale, 2015). For such complex natural language processing (NLP) applications, it is necessary to rely on appropriate tools to precisely understand the text and better find the potential relevant documents. The rhetorical elements, such as zones or particular entities, can support NLP algorithms by focusing on the relevant elements of the text (Mann and Thompson, 1987).\nGiven a certain document that describes an animal experiment for a certain research goal, hereafter called input document, we would like to find potential publications, hereafter called candidate documents, that describe an alternative method for the same research goal. Thus, some of the scientific elements should be similar between input and candidate documents, e.g. research goals and outcomes, while some others should be different, e.g. methods. Finding an alternative method to animal experiment requires two tasks: (a) performing a text similarity task with respect to some aspects of the publication, and (b) precisely understanding the proposed method with respect to the 3R principles. Therefore, the extraction of rhetorical elements has the potential to boost performance for these tasks.\nPrevious works have proposed many schemes for rhetorical elements in scientific publication, as reviewed in Webber et al. (2012). In a more recent survey, Nasar et al. (2018) present a good overview on both metadata and schemes for scientific articles. On the one hand, many of these schemes are not supported by an annotated corpus for training suitable information extraction tools. On the other hand, some tools based on these schemes are readily available for use.\nWe surveyed published schemes for rhetorical elements, whether focused on the biomedical domain or not, and we present a short overview on these. For those schemes for which we could find available tools, the latter was used to process a collection of 562 biomedical abstracts. We performed a comparison of the output (rhetorical elements) from the tools in the scope of a text similarity task on a manually annotated dataset. In this work, we limited our evaluation for text similarity but did not address whether the proposed methods comply with the 3R principles.\nIn summary, the contributions of this work are the following: (a) a short survey on existing schemes and corpora for rhetorical elements in scientific publications; (b) the identification of the schemes for which available tools are readily available for use; and (c) the evaluation of the available tools on a biomedical use case for text similarity. The next section presents a survey on the available schemes, followed by the methodology that we propose to compare the tools in the scope of text similarity.

It consists of splitting the publications (whether abstracts or full texts) on zones according to its scientific content, e.g. introduction, methods, results. Shimbo et al. (2003) proposed five categories and used structured abstracts from Medline while Hirohata et al. (2008) suggested four zoning categories. Further, Mullen et al. (2005) proposed a schema in which labels are grouped in three groups. Agarwal and Yu (2009) defined four categories (IMRAD schema) and manually annotated 148 articles, which was also used by Varga et al. (2012) for the annotation of more than 1,000 biomedical articles. Ruch et al. (2007) also annotated and tried machine learning in biomedical abstracts. However, none of the above data seems to be available for use, but we found many schemes with available corpora: AZ (Teufel and Moens, 2002). The Argumentative Zoning (AZ) schema was first proposed by Teufel and Moens (2002) and an annotated corpus is freely available for download 1 . The schema is composed of seven rhetorical categories and the corresponding corpus contains 80 articles on computational linguistics. Teufel et al. (2009) extended the schema to 11 categories (the AZ-II schema), applied it to chemistry papers, and later compared it to the CoreSC schema ). 2 Later, Kova\u010devi\u0107 et al. (2012) annotated 110 articles in computational linguistics with a modified version of the AZ labels. Mizuta et al. (2006) also adapted the AZ schema to biomedicine by annotating 20 full-text articles.\nCoreSC . This schema consists of three layers of labels and the corresponding ART corpus 4 is composed of 225 full texts. The corpus and schema were used in Guo et al. (2010) (just the first layer) and in Liakata et al. (2012a) for two life sciences applications, while Liakata et al. (2012b) compared it to a schema for biomedical events and developed the the SAPIENTA software 5 .\nDr. Inventor Fisas et al., 2015). The Dr. Inventor Framework proposes five categories and annotated 40 Computer Graphics papers, the so-called Dr. Inventor Rhetorically Annotated Corpus. Later, they also annotated another layer for citation purposes (Fisas et al., 2016). An extension of this schema with argumentative components and relations was recently published (Lauscher et al., 2018b), along with a tool for the prediction of the scientific elements (Lauscher et al., 2018a).\nMAZEA (Dayrell et al., 2012).

For this purpose, we model our problem as the following: given an input document that describes an animal experiment, we would like to mine similar candidate documents that are potential alternatives to animal testing. Our definition of similarity requires that both input and candidate documents should have similar research goal and comparable outcomes. However, the methods in the input document should be substantial different from those in the candidate documents. Therefore, we aim to compare input and candidate documents based on certain rhetorical elements as opposed to using the whole text.\nOur evaluation datasets consist of seven input documents from Medline whose identifiers (PMIDs) are 11489449, 11932745, 16192371, 16850029, 19735549, 21494637 and 24204323. For each input document, we collected the top 200 documents (titles and abstracts) retrieved from PubMed's \"similar articles\" functionality. On one hand, the candidate documents are already very similar to the input document. On the other hand, the list of candidates returned by PubMed does not consider our definition of similarity.\nIn order to build a suitable test set for our use case, a biomedical researcher manually validated at least the top 100 documents with regards to three degrees of similarity: very similar, similar and not similar. These three labels only consider the similarity of the research goals of each pair of abstracts (input vs. candidate documents) but do not address the 3R principles. Some documents were ignored because either they were only partially similar or because no decision could be made only based on the title and the abstract.\nAfter manual validation by the expert, our seven datasets encompass a total of 562 publications (titles and abstracts). Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the labels for each input document. Only four from the seven input documents had very similar publications (from only 2 to 8 of them), while similar ones (from only 4 to 19) could be found for all of them. However, the non similar publications are still the largest part (from 56 to 76) of the list. The annotated data is available for download 12 .\nSome of the tools that we compared require some linguistic information not originally included in our documents, such as sentences and tokens. We utilized syntok 13 for both sentence splitting and tokenization to build input data for one of 12 https://github.com/mariananeves/ scientific-elements-text-similarity 13 https://github.com/fnl/syntok the tools, namely, Prasad and Kan (2017).", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Tools", "text": "We found a few available tools that address some of schemes discussed in Section 2. However, we had dismiss some of them due to various problems.\nWe experienced many problems with the Ten-sorFlow library while trying the tool 14 developed by (Eger et al., 2017) for the ScienceIE schema. The tool seems to require a version of the library that it is no longer available and we could not resolve this issue not even after contacting the tool's developers. We also dismissed the tool 15 from Jin and Szolovits (2018) for the PIBOSO and Pub-MedRCT schemes. The installation worked but we were not able to train it due to memory problems. Finally, we did not try the tool 16 from Luan et al. (2018) since it addresses a relationbased schema (G\u00e1bor) that requires pre-tagged entities. Using named entities provided by other tools would probably add too much noise to the experiment. Finally, we had to dismiss the SAPI-ENTA tool (Liakata et al., 2012b) because it only allows uploading documents one by one to the Web application and we could not overcome this problem. We describe below the four tools that we tried for the extraction of rhetorical elements. Examples for the sentence-based (zones) and entitybased annotations are shown in Figure 2. We released in the GitHub repository the annotations extracted by the tools in the JSON format supported by the TextAE tool 17 . Achakulvisut et al. 18 (Achakulvisut et al., 2018) (PubMedRCT schema). It addresses the PubMed RCT schema, thus provides predictions for five zoning labels, namely, \"Background\", \"Objective\", \"Method\", \"Results\" and \"Conclusions\". We utilized the pre-trained models for Conditional Random Fields (CRF) as provided by the tool. Given that there is no publication, it is not clear what methods are behind the available models, but probably CRF.\nArguminSci 19 (Lauscher et al., 2018a) (Dr. Inventor schema extended). ArguminSci is available both for download as well as on-line (Web application). It provides predictions for five schemes but we considered only the \"Discourse Role Classification (DRC)\" whose labels are \"Background\", \"Challenge\", \"Approach\", \"Outcome\" and \"Future Work\".

Therefore, we calculated the similarity between the input and candidate documents, either based on the whole text or on selected rhetorical elements as provided by the tools. When utilizing the output from the various tools, we built a pseudo-document based either on the sentences or entities that we obtained. For the zoning tools, we concatenated the sentences to form a single text, while we printed the entities (one per line) for the entity-based predictions. Similarly, when evaluating combination of various labels, we concatenated the text from various labels into a single file.\nWe performed text similarity using the TextFlow tool (Mrabet et al., 2017) and utilized these similarity scores to rank the candidate documents. Subsequently, we evaluated the ranked list with regard the metrics of precision, recall and f-score at rank 10, i.e. P@10, R@10 and F@10. P@10 is the rate of correct positive candidate documents in the top 10 highest ranked documents, i.e. P @10 = T P @10 10 . The R@10 corresponds to the rate of positives candidate documents in the top 10 over the total of all positive instances, i.e. R@10 = T P @10 N um.P ositive . Finally, the F@10 is the harmonic average of the P@10 and R@10 above, i.e. F @10 = 2 * P @10 * R@10 P @10+R@10 . We considered as positive examples all those publications manually classified by our expert as \"very similar\" or \"similar\". Given the few of these instances in our datasets, we decided to make no distinction between both categories. As a result, the number of positive examples for the input documents in Figure 1 are 4, 10, 16, 11, 8, 23 and 6, respectively. We evaluated at rank 10 due to the reason that only two datasets have more than 20 positive instances, while only two of them over 10 positive instances. For datasets which contain more than 10 positive examples, we considered the number of positive instances to be equal to 10 in the equation of R@10. For the final comparison between the various tools and baselines, we per- formed an average of the metrics over the seven datasets.\nWe defined two baselines for comparison: (i) the original order of the candidate documents as returned by PubMed's \"similar articles\" functionality; and (ii) string similarity based on the whole text (title and abstract) without any pre-processing on the text. For the first baseline, we searched in PubMed for each of the seven PMIDs and downloaded the list of the top 100 similar articles (stand of March 13th, 2019).

We performed a total of 38 experiments which includes the four tools and baselines, as well as some combinations of selected labels from the tools. The combination of labels were decided based on the performance of the single labels and on our understanding of which labels are more relevant for our use case. Table 2 presents the results for our two baselines and the best results for each tool. In the following we specify the labels that obtained the best results:\n\u2022 Achakulvisut et al: the combination of all labels, i.e. \"Background-Conclusions-Methods-Objective-Results\"\n\u2022 ArguminSci: two combinations of labels were equally good: \"Background-Challenge- Table 2: Summary of the results from the two baselines (two first rows) and when using the selected tools.\nThe maximum scores represent the maximum value of P@10, R@10 and F@10 that could have been obtained by any of the approaches.

Further, three tools scored higher than our strong baseline that uses TextFlow over the whole text (titles and abstracts). Two of the tools (Achakulvisut et al and ArguminSci) address zoning elements while one of them (Prasad and Kan) returns entity-level annotations. However, none of the tools scored close the maximum possible scores. Given that we do not have at least 10 positive instances (\"very similar\" or \"similar\") for some of our input documents, our maximum P@10 is of 0.83 instead of 1.0.\nThe three zoning tools rely on labels that can  be mapped to one another, as shown by the order of their labels in Table 3. When examining the performance of single labels, only the \"Outcome\" label from ArguminSci tool could perform close our strong baseline.\nThe labels that we expected to be more relevant, i.e. the ones more related to the background and outcome sections and less with the methods section, did not always perform better in the ranking task. For instance, the F@10 obtained by the label \"Approach\" from ArguminSci performed slightly better (0.28) than the \"Background\" (0.24) and \"Challenge\" (0.24) labels. Similarly, the label \"Method\" from MAZEA performed better (0.32) than \"Background\" (0.25) and \"Purpose\" (0.25) sections. We wonder whether the good performance of methods-related labels were actually due to mistakes in the classification performed by the tools.\nOur experiments showed that a combination of labels always performed better than the single ones, while some combinations of labels performed better than others (cf. Figure 3).

Many of the documents that we missed are certainly due to the limitation of considering only the top 10 highest ranked positions. However, none of the experiments obtained a recall of 1.0. The highest recall that we obtained was 0.9 for the dataset 3 (16192371) using the Argu-minSci tool and either the single label \"Outcome\" or the combination of labels \"Challenge-Outcome-FutureWork\".\nOn one hand, five documents were missed by all experiments (38 times), namely, candidate documents \"19155551\", \"29133591\", \"21362567\", \"19667187\" and \"26047474\" from datasets 3, 5, 6, 6, and 7, respectively. On the other hand, the candidate document \"25174890\" from dataset 6 was the least missed one: only by three experiments. A total of 333 documents were wrongly classified as positive, i.e. were placed among the top 10 ones, by any of the 38 experiments. No candidate document was mistakenly classified by all approaches, but the more frequent ones were: \"21501651\" (27 times) and \"23571276\" (25 times), both from dataset 4, and \"11494364\" (25 times) from dataset 7. Our expert checked again the labels assigned to the top FPs and FNs above described and confirmed that their labels are correct and that the documents have been wrongly classified by the corresponding approaches.\nOur experiments have shown that many of the tools can indeed support our use case, specially when compared to the original list provided by PubMed. Regarding the integration of these tools into a workflow, one of the tools is currently not available (MAZEA), while all the others need some adaptations to be used in real-life applications. With respect to the methods behind the tools, ArguminSci, which is based on LSTM, performed slightly better than the ones based on CRF (Achakulvisut et al, Prasad and Kan) and superior than the machine learning algorithms in MAZEA. However, we did not evaluate the predictions made by the tools, but only their impact in a specific text similarity task. We expected that the best performing tools would be the ones that utilized corpora specifically built for the biomedical domain. From the tools that we evaluated, only Achakulvisut et al and MAZEA were specifically trained on documents from the biomedical or health domains. Nevertheless, ArguminSci, the best performing one, was trained on documents from computer graphics while and Prasad and Kan utilizes documents about computational linguistics.\nWe also investigated whether there was any impact of the document type in the corpora, i.e. either full texts or only abstracts, on the performance of the corresponding tools. However, we did not observe any clear association between these two aspects. While the best performing tool (Argu-minSci) was trained on full texts, Achakulvisut et al utilizes only Medline abstracts. Similar to Ar-guminSci, the tool from Prasad and Kan is also based on full text documents.\nWe carried out experiments with various tools but limited to a very specific use case. Even though our datasets contains a reasonable number of documents (562), the similarity of the candidate documents was computed with respect to only seven input documents, and datasets were annotated by only one annotator. Further, we only considered titles and abstracts in our evaluation, while some tools were trained on full-text documents.
