Recent advances in GPU hardware have led to the emergence of bi-directional LSTMs as a standard method for obtaining pertoken vector representations serving as input to labeling tasks such as NER (often followed by prediction in a linear-chain CRF). Though expressive and accurate, these models fail to fully exploit GPU parallelism, limiting their computational efficiency. This paper proposes a faster alternative to Bi-LSTMs for NER: Iterated Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (ID-CNNs), which have better capacity than traditional CNNs for large context and structured prediction. Unlike LSTMs whose sequential processing on sentences of length N requires O(N ) time even in the face of parallelism, ID-CNNs permit fixed-depth convolutions to run in parallel across entire documents. We describe a distinct combination of network structure, parameter sharing and training procedures that enable dramatic 14-20x testtime speedups while retaining accuracy comparable to the Bi-LSTM-CRF. Moreover, ID-CNNs trained to aggregate context from the entire document are even more accurate while maintaining 8x faster test time speeds.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In order to democratize large-scale NLP and information extraction while minimizing our environmental footprint, we require fast, resource-efficient methods for sequence tagging tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition (NER). Speed is not sufficient of course: they must also be expressive enough to tolerate the tremendous lexical variation in input data.\nThe massively parallel computation facilitated by GPU hardware has led to a surge of successful neural network architectures for sequence labeling (Ling et al., 2015;Ma and Hovy, 2016;Chiu and Nichols, 2016;Lample et al., 2016). While these models are expressive and accurate, they fail to fully exploit the parallelism opportunities of a GPU, and thus their speed is limited. Specifically, they employ either recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for feature extraction, or Viterbi inference in a structured output model, both of which require sequential computation across the length of the input.\nInstead, parallelized runtime independent of the length of the sequence saves time and energy costs, maximizing GPU resource usage and minimizing the amount of time it takes to train and evaluate models. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide exactly this property (Kim, 2014;Kalchbrenner et al., 2014). Rather than composing representations incrementally over each token in a sequence, they apply filters in parallel across the entire sequence at once. Their computational cost grows with the number of layers, but not the input size, up to the memory and threading limitations of the hardware. This provides, for example, audio generation models that can be trained in parallel .\nDespite the clear computational advantages of CNNs, RNNs have become the standard method for composing deep representations of text. This is because a token encoded by a bidirectional RNN will incorporate evidence from the entire input sequence, but the CNN's representation is limited by the effective input width 1 of the network: the size of the input context which is observed, directly or indirectly, by the representation of a token at a given layer in the network. Specifically, in a network composed of a series of stacked convolutional layers of convolution width w, the number r of context tokens incorporated into a token's representation at a given layer l, is given by r = l(w \u2212 1) + 1. The number of layers required to incorporate the entire input context grows linearly with the length of the sequence. To avoid this scaling, one could pool representations across the sequence, but this is not appropriate for sequence labeling, since it reduces the output resolution of the representation.\nIn response, this paper presents an application of dilated convolutions (Yu and Koltun, 2016) for sequence labeling (Figure 1). For dilated convolutions, the effective input width can grow exponentially with the depth, with no loss in resolution at each layer and with a modest number of parameters to estimate. Like typical CNN layers, dilated convolutions operate on a sliding window of context over the sequence, but unlike conventional convolutions, the context need not be consecutive; the dilated window skips over every dilation width d inputs. By stacking layers of dilated convolutions of exponentially increasing dilation width, we can expand the size of the effective input width to cover the entire length of most sequences using only a few layers: The size of the effective input width for a token at layer l is now given by 2 l+1 \u22121. More concretely, just four stacked dilated convolutions of width 3 produces token representations with a n effective input width of 31 tokens -longer than the average sentence length (23) in the Penn TreeBank.\nOur overall iterated dilated CNN architecture (ID-CNN) repeatedly applies the same block of dilated convolutions to token-wise representations. This parameter sharing prevents overfitting and also provides opportunities to inject supervision on intermediate activations of the network. Similar to models that use logits produced by an RNN, the ID-CNN provides two methods for performing prediction: we can predict each token's label independently, or by running Viterbi inference in a chain structured graphical model.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "In experiments on CoNLL 2003 and OntoNotes", "text": "1 What we call effective input width here is known as the receptive field in the vision literature, drawing an analogy to the visual receptive field of a neuron in the retina. 5.0 English NER, we demonstrate significant speed gains of our ID-CNNs over various recurrent models, while maintaining similar F1 performance. When performing prediction using independent classification, the ID-CNN consistently outperforms a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and performs on par with inference in a CRF with logits from a Bi-LSTM (Bi-LSTM-CRF). As an extractor of per-token logits for a CRF, our model out-performs the Bi-LSTM-CRF. We also apply ID-CNNs to entire documents, where independent token classification is as accurate as the Bi-LSTM-CRF while decoding almost 8\u00d7 faster. The clear accuracy gains resulting from incorporating broader context suggest that these models could similarly benefit many other contextsensitive NLP tasks which have until now been limited by the computational complexity of existing context-rich models. 2 2 Background", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conditional Probability Models for Tagging", "text": "Let x = [x 1 , . . . , x T ] be our input text and y = [y 1 , . . . , y T ] be per-token output tags. Let D be the domain size of each y i . We predict the most likely y, given a conditional model P (y|x). This paper considers two factorizations of the conditional distribution. First, we have\nP (y|x) = T t=1 P (y t |F (x)),(1)\nwhere the tags are conditionally independent given some features for x. Given these features, O(D) prediction is simple and parallelizable across the length of the sequence. However, feature extraction may not necessarily be parallelizable. For example, RNN-based features require iterative passes along the length of x.\nWe also consider a linear-chain CRF model that couples all of y together:\nP (y|x) = 1 Z x T t=1 \u03c8 t (y t |F (x))\u03c8 p (y t , y t\u22121 ), (2)\nwhere \u03c8 t is a local factor, \u03c8 p is a pairwise factor that scores consecutive tags, and Z x is the partition function (Lafferty et al., 2001). To avoid overfitting, \u03c8 p does not depend on the timestep t or the input x in our experiments. Prediction in this model requires global search using the O(D 2 T ) Viterbi algorithm. CRF prediction explicitly reasons about interactions among neighboring output tags, whereas prediction in the first model compiles this reasoning into the feature extraction step (Liang et al., 2008). The suitability of such compilation depends on the properties and quantity of the data. While CRF prediction requires non-trivial search in output space, it can guarantee that certain output constraints, such as for IOB tagging (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999), will always be satisfied. It may also have better sample complexity, as it imposes more prior knowledge about the structure of the interactions among the tags (London et al., 2016). However, it has worse computational complexity than independent prediction.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Dilated Convolutions", "text": "CNNs in NLP are typically one-dimensional, applied to a sequence of vectors representing tokens rather than to a two-dimensional grid of vectors representing pixels.

Here, and throughout the paper, we do not explicitly write the bias terms in affine transformations. The convolutional operator applied to each token x t with output c t is defined as:\nc t = W c r k=0 x t\u00b1k ,(3)\nwhere \u2295 is vector concatenation.

First described for pixel classification in computer vision, Yu and Koltun (2016) achieve state-of-the-art results on image segmentation benchmarks by stacking dilated convolutions with exponentially increasing rates of dilation, a technique they refer to as multiscale context aggregation. By feeding the outputs of each dilated convolution as the input to the next, increasingly non-local information is incorporated into each pixel's representation. Performing a dilation-1 convolution in the first layer ensures that no pixels within the effective input width of any pixel are excluded. By doubling the dilation width at each layer, the size of the effective input width grows exponentially while the number of parameters grows only linearly with the number of layers, so a pixel representation quickly incorporates rich global evidence from the entire image.\nUnfortunately, simply increasing the depth of stacked dilated CNNs causes considerable overfitting in our experiments. In response, we present Iterated Dilated CNNs (ID-CNNs), which instead apply the same small stack of dilated convolutions multiple times, each iterate taking as input the result of the last application. Repeatedly employing the same parameters in a recurrent fashion provides both broad effective input width and desirable generalization capabilities.

(2)), where the partition function and its gradient are computed using the forward-backward algorithm.\nWe next present an alternative training method that helps bridge the gap between these two techniques. Sec. 2.1 identifies that the CRF has preferable sample complexity and accuracy since prediction directly reasons in the space of structured outputs. In response, we compile some of this reasoning in output space into ID-CNN feature extraction. Instead of explicit reasoning over output labels during inference, we train the network such that each block is predictive of output labels. Subsequent blocks learn to correct dependency violations of their predecessors, refining the final sequence prediction.\nTo do so, we first define predictions of the model after each of the L b applications of the block. Let h t (k) be the result of applying the matrix W o from (9) to b t (k) , the output of block k.

The version of dropout typically used in practice has the undesirable property that the randomized predictor used at train time differs from the fixed one used at test time. Ma et al.

These outperform similar systems that use the same features, but independent local predictions. On the other hand, the greedy sequential prediction (Daum\u00e9 III et al., 2009) approach of Ratinov and Roth (2009), which employs lexicalized features, gazetteers, and word clusters, outperforms CRFs with similar features.\nLSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) were used for NER as early as the CoNLL shared task in 2003 (Hammerton, 2003;Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). More recently, a wide variety of neural network architectures for NER have been proposed. Collobert et al. (2011) employ a one-layer CNN with pre-trained word embeddings, capitalization and lexicon features, and CRF-based prediction. Huang et al. (2015) achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on partof-speech, chunking and NER using a Bi-LSTM-CRF. Lample et al. (2016) proposed two models which incorporated Bi-LSTM-composed character embeddings alongside words: a Bi-LSTM-CRF, and a greedy stack LSTM which uses a simple shift-reduce grammar to compose words into labeled entities. Their Bi-LSTM-CRF obtained the state-of-the-art on four languages without word shape or lexicon features. Ma and Hovy (2016) use CNNs rather than LSTMs to compose characters in a Bi-LSTM-CRF, achieving state-ofthe-art performance on part-of-speech tagging and CoNLL NER without lexicons. Chiu and Nichols (2016) evaluate a similar network but propose a novel method for encoding lexicon matches, presenting results on CoNLL and OntoNotes NER. Yang et al. (2016) use GRU-CRFs with GRUcomposed character embeddings of words to train a single network on many tasks and languages.\nIn general, distributed representations for text can provide useful generalization capabilities for NER systems, since they can leverage unsupervised pre-training of distributed word representations (Turian et al., 2010;Collobert et al., 2011;Passos et al., 2014). Though our models would also likely benefit from additional features such as character representations and lexicons, we focus on simpler models which use word-embeddings alone, leaving more elaborate input representations to future work.\nIn these NER approaches, CNNs were used for low-level feature extraction that feeds into alternative architectures. Overall, end-to-end CNNs have mainly been used in NLP for sentence classification, where the output representation is lower resolution than that of the input Kim (2014); Kalchbrenner et al. (2014); ; Toutanova et al. (2015). Lei et al. (2015) present a CNN variant where convolutions adaptively skip neighboring words. While the flexibility of this model is powerful, its adaptive behavior is not well-suited to GPU acceleration.\nOur work draws on the use of dilated convolutions for image segmentation in the computer vision community (Yu and Koltun, 2016;Chen et al., 2015). Similar to our block, Yu and Koltun (2016) employ a context-module of stacked dilated convolutions of exponentially increasing dilation width. Dilated convolutions were recently applied to the task of speech generation (van den , and concurrent with this work,  posted a pre-print describing the similar ByteNet network for machine translation that uses dilated convolutions in the encoder and decoder components. Our basic model architecture is similar to that of the ByteNet encoder, except that the inputs to our model are tokens and not bytes. Additionally, we present a novel loss and parameter sharing scheme to facilitate training models on much smaller datasets than those used by . We are the first to use dilated convolutions for sequence labeling.\nThe broad effective input width of the ID-CNN helps aggregate document-level context. Ratinov and Roth (2009) incorporate document context in their greedy model by adding features based on tagged entities within a large, fixed window of tokens.
