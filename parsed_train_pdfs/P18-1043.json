For example, an ideal dialogue system should react in empathetic ways by reasoning about the human user's mental state based on the events the user has experienced, without the user explicitly stating how they are feeling. Similarly, advertisement systems on social media should be able to reason about the emotional reactions of people after events such as mass shootings and remove ads for guns which might increase social distress (Goel and Isaac, 2016). Also, pragmatic inference is a necessary step toward automatic narrative understanding and generation (Tomai and Forbus, 2010;Ding and Riloff, 2016;Ding et al., 2017). However, this type of social commonsense reasoning goes far beyond the widely studied entailment tasks (Bowman et al., 2015;Dagan et al., 2006) and thus falls outside the scope of existing benchmarks.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new task, corpus, and model, supporting commonsense inference on events with a specific focus on modeling stereotypical intents and reactions of people, described in short free-form text. Our study is in a similar spirit to recent efforts of Ding and Riloff (2016) and Zhang et al. (2017), in that we aim to model aspects of commonsense inference via natural language descriptions. Our new contributions are:\n(1) a new corpus that supports commonsense inference about people's intents and reactions over a diverse range of everyday events and situations, (2) inference about even those people who are not directly mentioned by the event phrase, and (3) a task formulation that aims to generate the textual descriptions of intents and reactions, instead of classifying their polarities or classifying the inference relations between two given textual descriptions.\nOur work establishes baseline performance on this new task, demonstrating that, given the phrase-level inference dataset, neural encoderdecoder models can successfully compose phrasal embeddings for previously unseen events and reason about the mental states of their participants. Furthermore, in order to showcase the practical implications of commonsense inference on events and people's mental states, we apply our model to modern movie scripts, which provide a new insight into the gender bias in modern films beyond what previous studies have offered (England et al., 2011;Agarwal et al., 2015;Ramakrishna et al., 2017;Sap et al., 2017).

While there has been much prior research on phrase-level paraphrases (Pavlick et al., 2015) and phrase-level entailment (Dagan et al., 2006), relatively little prior work focused on phrase-level inference that requires prag-matic or commonsense interpretation. We scope our study to two distinct types of inference: given a phrase that describes an event, we want to reason about the likely intents and emotional reactions of people who caused or affected by the event. This complements prior work on more general commonsense inference (Speer and Havasi, 2012;Li et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2017), by focusing on the causal relations between events and people's mental states, which are not well covered by most existing resources.\nWe collect a wide range of phrasal event descriptions from stories, blogs, and Wiktionary idioms. Compared to prior work on phrasal embeddings (Wieting et al., 2015;Pavlick et al., 2015), our work generalizes the phrases by introducing (typed) variables. In particular, we replace words that correspond to entity mentions or pronouns with typed variables such as PersonX or PersonY, as shown in examples in Table 1. More formally, the phrases we extract are a combination of a verb predicate with partially instantiated arguments. We keep specific arguments together with the predicate, if they appear frequently enough (e.g., PersonX eats pasta for dinner). Otherwise, the arguments are replaced with an untyped blank (e.g., PersonX eats for dinner).

We define reaction as an explanation of how the mental states of the agent and other people involved in the event would change as a result. The reaction can be considered a mental post-condition of an action or an event.

We also ask annotators to provide up to three possible reactions of other people, when applicable.

The individual \uf8ff scores generally indicate that turkers disagree half as often as if they were randomly selecting answers.\nImportantly, this level of agreement is acceptable in our task formulation for two reasons. First, unlike linguistic annotations on syntax or semantics where experts in the corresponding theory would generally agree on a single correct label, pragmatic interpretations may better be defined as distributions over multiple correct labels (e.g., after PersonX takes a test, PersonX might feel relieved and/or stressed; de Marneffe et al., 2012). Second, because we formulate our task as a conditional language modeling problem, where a distribution over the textual descriptions of intents and reactions is conditioned on the event description, this variation in the labels is only as expected.\nA majority of our events are annotated as willingly caused by the agent (86%, Cohen's \uf8ff = 0.48), and 26% involve other people (\uf8ff = 0.41).

The general outline of our model architecture is illustrated in Figure 3.\nThe input to our model is an event pattern described through free-form text with typed variables such as PersonX gives PersonY as a gift. For notation purposes, we describe each event pattern E as a sequence of word embeddings he 1 , e 2 , . . . , e n i 2 R n\u21e5D . This input is encoded as a vector h E 2 R H that will be used for predicting output. The output of the model is its hypotheses about PersonX's intent, PersonX's reaction, and others' reactions (v i ,v x , and v o , respectively). We experiment with representing the From an encoded event, our model predicts intents and reactions in a multitask setting.\noutput in two decoding set-ups: three vectors interpretable as discrete distributions over words and phrases (n-gram reranking) or three sequences of words (sequence decoding).\nEncoding events The input event phrase E is compressed into an H-dimensional embedding h E via an encoding function f :\nR n\u21e5D ! R H : h E = f (e 1 , . . . , e n )\nWe experiment with several ways for defining f , inspired by standard techniques in sentence and phrase classification (Kim, 2014). First, we experiment with max-pooling and mean-pooling over the word vectors {e i } n i=1 . We also consider a convolutional neural network (ConvNet;LeCun et al., 1998) taking the last layer of the network as the encoded version of the event. Lastly, we encode the event phrase with a bi-directional RNN (specifically, a GRU; Cho et al., 2014), concatenating the final hidden states of the forward and backward cells as the encoding:\nh E = [ ! h n ; h 1 ].\nFor hyperparameters and other details, we refer the reader to Appendix B.\nThough the event sequences are typically rather short (4.6 tokens on average), our model still benefits from the ConvNet and BiRNN's ability to compose words.\nPragmatic inference decoding We use three decoding modules that take the event phrase embedding h E and output distributions of possible PersonX's intent (v i ), PersonX's reactions (v x ), and others' reactions (v o ). We experiment with two different decoder set-ups.\nFirst, we experiment with n-gram re-ranking, considering the |V | most frequent {1, 2, 3}grams in our annotations. Each decoder projects the event phrase embedding h E into a |V |dimensional vector, which is then passed through a softmax function. For instance, the distribution over descriptions of PersonX's intent is given by:\nv i = softmax(W i h E + b i )\nSecond, we experiment with sequence generation, using RNN decoders to generate the textual description. The event phrase embedding h E is set as the initial state h dec of three decoder RNNs (using GRU cells), which then output the intent/reactions one word at a time (using beam-search at test time). For example, an event's intent sequence\n(v i = v (0) i v (1) i . . .) is computed as follows: v (t+1) i = softmax(W i RNN(v (t) i , h (t) i,dec ) + b i )\nTraining objective We minimize the crossentropy between the predicted distribution over words and phrases, against the one actually observed in our dataset. Further, we employ multitask learning, simultaneously minimizing the loss for all three decoders at each iteration.\nTraining details We fix our input embeddings, using 300-dimensional skip-gram word embeddings trained on Google News (Mikolov et al., 2013). For decoding, we consider a vocabulary of size |V | = 14,034 in the n-gram re-ranking setup. For the sequence decoding setup, we only consider the unigrams in V , yielding an output space of 7,110 at each time step.\nWe randomly divided our set of 24,716 unique events (57,094 annotations) into a training/dev./test set using an 80/10/10% split. Some annotations have multiple responses (i.e., a crowdworker gave multiple possible intents and reactions), in which case we take each of the combinations of their responses as a separate training example.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Empirical Results", "text": "Table 3 summarizes the performance of different encoding models on the dev and test set in terms of cross-entropy and recall at 10 predicted intents and reactions.

Note that because of two different decoding setups, cross-entropy between n-gram and sequence decoding are not directly comparable.\ncoding setups). Additionally, BiRNN models outperform ConvNets on cross-entropy in both decoding setups. Looking at the recall split across intent vs. reaction labels (\"Intent\", \"XReact\" and \"OReact\" columns), we see that much of the improvement in using these two models is within the prediction of PersonX's intents. Note that recall for \"OReact\" is much higher, since a majority of events do not involve other people.\nHuman evaluation To further assess the quality of our models, we randomly select 100 events from our test set and ask crowd-workers to rate generated intents and reactions. We present 5 workers with an event's top 10 most likely intents and reactions according to our model and ask them to select all those that make sense to them. We evaluate each model's precision @10 by computing the average number of generated responses that make sense to annotators. Figure 4 summarizes the results of this evaluation. In most cases, the performance is higher for the sequential decoder than the corresponding n-gram decoder. The biggest gain from using sequence decoders is in intent prediction, possibly because intent explanations are more likely to be longer. The BiRNN and ConvNet encoders consistently have higher precision than the mean-pooling with the BiRNN-seq setup slightly outperforming other models. Unless otherwise specified, this is the model we employ in further sections.  ilar for all three sets of events, it is 10% behind intent prediction on the full development set. Additionally, predicting other people's reactions is more difficult for the model when other people are explicitly mentioned. Unsurprisingly, idioms are particularly difficult for commonsense inference, perhaps due to the difficulty in composing meaning over nonliteral or noncompositional event descriptions.\nTo further evaluate the geometry of the embedding space, we analyze interpolations between pairs of event phrases (from outside the train set), similar to the homotopic analysis of Bowman et al. (2016). For a handful of event pairs, we decode intents, reactions for PersonX, and reactions for other people from points sampled at equal inter-vals on the interpolated line between two event phrases. We show examples in Figure 5.
