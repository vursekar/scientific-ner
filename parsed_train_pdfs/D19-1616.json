The availability of datasets for the task of multilingual text summarization is rare, and such datasets are difficult to construct. In this work, we build an abstract text summarizer for the German language text using the state-of-the-art \"Transformer\" model. We propose an iterative data augmentation approach which uses synthetic data along with the real summarization data for the German language. To generate synthetic data, the Common Crawl (German) dataset is exploited, which covers different domains. The synthetic data is effective for the low resource condition and is particularly helpful for our multilingual scenario where availability of summarizing data is still a challenging issue. The data are also useful in deep learning scenarios where the neural models require a large amount of training data for utilization of its capacity. The obtained summarization performance is measured in terms of ROUGE and BLEU score. We achieve an absolute improvement of +1.5 and +16.0 in ROUGE1 F1 (R1 F1) on the development and test sets, respectively, compared to the system which does not rely on data augmentation.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Automatic text summarization is considered as a challenging task because while summarizing a piece of text, we read it entirely to develop our understanding to prepare highlighting its main points. Due to the lack of human knowledge and language processing abilities in computers, automatic text summarization is a major non-trivial task (Allahyari et al., 2017).\nTwo major approaches for automatic summarization are: extractive and abstractive. The extractive summarization approach produces summaries by choosing a subset of sentences in the original text. The abstract text summarization approach aims to shorten the long text into a humanreadable form that contains the most important fact from the original text (Allahyari et al., 2017;Kry\u015bci\u0144ski et al., 2018).\nThe deep learning-based neural attention model when applying to abstract text summarization performs well compared to standard learning-based approaches (Rush et al., 2015). Abstract text summarization using the attentional encoder-decoder recurrent neural network approach shows a stateof-the-art performance and sets a baseline model (Nallapati et al., 2016). Further improvements are introduced to the baseline model by using the pointer generator network and coverage mechanism using reinforcement learning based training procedure (See et al., 2017;Paulus et al., 2017). There is an inherent limitation to natural language processing tasks such as text summarization for resource-poor and morphological complex languages owing to a shortage of quality linguistic data available (Kurniawan and Louvan, 2018). The use of synthetic data along with the real data is one of the popular approaches followed in machine translation domain for the low resource conditions to improve the translation quality (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011;Hoang et al., 2018;Chinea-R\u0131os et al., 2017). The iterative back-translation (e.g. training back-translation systems multiple times) were also found effective in machine translation (Hoang et al., 2018). We explore similar approaches in our experiments for the text summarization task.\nThe organizations of this paper is as follows: Section 1 describes related work on abstract text summarization. Section 2 explains the techniques followed in our work. Section 3 describes the dataset used in our experiment. Section 4 explains the experimental settings: models and their parameters.

In context to summarize, it takes text as input and provides its summary.\nWe use synthetic data as shown in Figure 1 to increase the size of the training data.

The automatic evaluation results based on the dev and test set are shown in Table 2 with sample summaries in Table 3. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, we use ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score, which is a popular metric for text summarization task, and has several variants like ROUGE-N, and ROUGE-L, which measure the overlap of n-grams between the system and reference summary (LIN, 2004). We use ROUGE 1 F1 (R1 F1), ROUGE 2 F1 (R2 F1), and ROUGE L F1 (RL F1) for scoring the generated summary. In addition, we also use the SacreBLEU 4 evaluation metric (Post, 2018).\nFigure 3 presents the learning curves for the models (S1 and S2) on the development set. It can be seen that there is a variance (e.g. word  selection, summary length) for model S2 generated summary as compared with model S1. During manual verification, we found that the summaries generated without a minimum length constraint appear better compared to summaries with minimum length constraint. Although we do not explicitly specify a minimum length parameter for generating summaries for the models, the average length of words generated by model S2 (e.g. 41.42 words) is longer than the model S1 (e.g. 39.81 words). Some data (e.g. name, year) were found inconsistent during a comparison of the generated summary with respect to the reference. There is a variance in summaries generated by model S3 as compared to S2 and S1. In terms of Rouge score model S3 outperforms model S1 but perform worse than model S2 (see Table 2).", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we highlighted the implementation of synthetic data for the abstract text summariza-Ref Summary : \"Das Feuerschiff Relandersgrund war ein finnisches Feuerschiff, das von 1888 bis 1914 im Schrenmeer bei Rauma positioniert war.
