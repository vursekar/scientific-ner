The task of Pub-MedQA is to answer research questions with yes/no/maybe (e.g.: Do preoperative statins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?) using the corresponding abstracts. PubMedQA has 1k expert-annotated, 61.2k unlabeled and 211.3k artificially generated QA instances. Each PubMedQA instance is composed of (1) a question which is either an existing research article title or derived from one, (2) a context which is the corresponding abstract without its conclusion, (3) a long answer, which is the conclusion of the abstract and, presumably, answers the research question, and (4) a yes/no/maybe answer which summarizes the conclusion. Pub-MedQA is the first QA dataset where reasoning over biomedical research texts, especially their quantitative contents, is required to answer the questions. Our best performing model, multi-phase fine-tuning of BioBERT with long answer bag-of-word statistics as additional supervision, achieves 68.1% accuracy, compared to single human performance of 78.0% accuracy and majority-baseline of 55.2% accuracy, leaving much room for improvement.

The question answering (QA) task, in which models learn how to answer questions, is often used as a benchmark for quantitatively measuring the reasoning and inferring abilities of such intelligent systems.\nWhile many large-scale annotated general domain QA datasets have been introduced (Rajpurkar et al., 2016;Lai et al., 2017;Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 Question: Do preoperative statins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent predictors of AF [...] Long Answer: (Conclusion) Our study indicated that preoperative statin therapy seems to reduce AF development after CABG. Answer: yes Figure 1: An instance (Sakamoto et al., 2011) of Pub-MedQA dataset: Question is the original question title; Context includes the structured abstract except its conclusive part, which serves as the Long Answer; Human experts annotated the Answer yes. Supporting fact for the answer is highlighted. Yang et al., 2018;, the largest annotated biomedical QA dataset, BioASQ (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015) has less than 3k training instances, most of which are simple factual questions. Some works proposed automatically constructed biomedical QA datasets (Pampari et al., 2018;Pappas et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2018), which have much larger sizes. However, questions of these datasets are mostly factoid, whose answers can be extracted in the contexts without much reasoning.\nIn this paper, we aim at building a biomedical QA dataset which (1) has substantial instances with some expert annotations and (2) requires reasoning over the contexts to answer the questions. For this, we turn to the PubMed 1 , a search engine providing access to over 25 million references of biomedical articles. We found that around 760k articles in PubMed use questions as their titles. Among them, the abstracts of about 120k articles are written in a structured style -meaning they have subsections of \"Introduction\", \"Results\" etc. Conclusive parts of the abstracts, often in \"Conclusions\", are the authors' answers to the question title. Other abstract parts can be viewed as the contexts for giving such answers. This pattern perfectly fits the scheme of QA, but modeling it as abstractive QA, where models learn to generate the conclusions, will result in an extremely hard task due to the variability of writing styles. Interestingly, more than half of the question titles of PubMed articles can be briefly answered by yes/no/maybe, which is significantly higher than the proportions of such questions in other datasets, e.g.: just 1% in Natural Questions  and 6% in HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018). Instead of using conclusions to answer the questions, we explore answering them with yes/no/maybe and treat the conclusions as a long answer for additional supervision.\nTo this end, we present PubMedQA, a biomedical QA dataset for answering research questions using yes/no/maybe. We collected all PubMed articles with question titles, and manually labeled 1k of them for cross-validation and testing. An example is shown in Fig. 1. The rest of yes/no/answerable QA instances compose of the unlabeled subset which can be used for semisupervised learning. Further, we automatically convert statement titles of 211.3k PubMed articles to questions and label them with yes/no answers using a simple heuristic. These artificially generated instances can be used for pre-training. Unlike other QA datasets in which questions are asked by crowd-workers for existing contexts (Rajpurkar et al., 2016;Yang et al., 2018;Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al., 2018), in PubMedQA contexts are generated to answer the questions and both are written by the same authors. This consistency assures that contexts are perfectly related to the questions, thus making PubMedQA an ideal benchmark for testing scientific reasoning abilities.\nAs an attempt to solve PubMedQA and provide a strong baseline, we fine-tune BioBERT  on different subsets in a multi-phase style with additional supervision of long answers. Though this model generates decent results and vastly outperforms other baselines, it's still much worse than the single-human performance, leaving significant room for future improvements.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Related Works", "text": "Biomedical QA: Expert-annotated biomedical QA datasets are limited by scale due to the difficulty of annotations. In 2006 and 2007, TREC 2 held QA challenges on genomics corpus (Hersh et al., 2006(Hersh et al., , 2007, where the task is to retrieve relevant documents for 36 and 38 topic questions, respectively. QA4MRE (Pe\u00f1as et al., 2013) included a QA task about Alzheimer's disease (Morante et al., 2012). This dataset has 40 QA instances and the task is to answer a question related to a given document using one of five answer choices. The QA task of BioASQ (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015) has phases of (a) retrieve question-related documents and (b) using related documents as contexts to answer yes/no, factoid, list or summary questions. BioASQ 2019 has a training set of 2,747 QA instances and a test set of 500 instances.\nSeveral large-scale automatically collected biomedical QA datasets have been introduced: emrQA (Pampari et al., 2018) is an extractive QA dataset for electronic medical records (EHR) built by re-purposing existing annotations on EHR corpora. BioRead (Pappas et al., 2018) and BMKC (Kim et al., 2018) both collect cloze-style QA instances by masking biomedical named entities in sentences of research articles and using other parts of the same article as context.\nYes/No QA: Datasets such as HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), Natural Questions , ShARC (Saeidi et al., 2018) and BioASQ (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015) contain yes/no questions as well as other types of questions. BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019) specifically focuses on naturally occurring yes/no questions, and those questions are shown to be surprisingly difficult to answer. We add a \"maybe\" choice in PubMedQA to cover uncertain instances.\nTypical neural approaches to answering yes/no questions involve encoding both the question and context, and decoding the encoding to a class output, which is similar to the well-studied natural language inference (NLI) task.\nRecent breakthroughs of pre-trained language models like ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) show significant performance im-  provements on NLI tasks. In this work, we use domain specific versions of them to set baseline performance on PubMedQA.\n3 PubMedQA Dataset", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data Collection", "text": "PubMedQA is split into three subsets: labeled, unlabeled and artificially generated.

Collection of PQA-L and PQA-U: PubMed articles which have i) a question mark in the titles and ii) a structured abstract with conclusive part are collected and denoted as pre-PQA-U. Now each instance has 1) a question which is the original title 2) a context which is the structured abstract without the conclusive part and 3) a long answer which is the conclusive part of the abstract. Two annotators 3 labeled 1k instances from pre-PQA-U with yes/no/maybe to build PQA-L using Algorithm 1.

For this, we use a simple rule-based method which removes all questions started with interrogative words (i.e. wh-words) or involving selections from multiple entities. This results in over 93% agreement with annotator 1 in identifying the questions that can be answered by yes/no/maybe.   statement titles are converted to questions by simply moving or adding copulas (\"is\", \"are\") or auxiliary verbs (\"does\", \"do\") in the front and further revising for coherence (e.g.: adding a question mark). We generate the yes/no answer according to negation status of the VB. Several examples are shown in Table 2.
