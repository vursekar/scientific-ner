The field of automatic knowledge graph completion (KGC), which is motivated by the fact that knowledge graphs are usually incomplete, is an active research direction spanning several subfields of artificial intelligence (Nickel et al., 2015;Ji et al., 2020).\nAs progress in artificial intelligence depends heavily on data, a relevant and high-quality benchmark is imperative to evaluating and advancing the state of the art in KGC. However, the field has largely remained static in this regard over the past decade. Outdated subsets of Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) are most commonly used for evaluation in KGC, even though Freebase had known quality issues (Tanon et al., 2016) and was eventually deprecated in favor of the more recent Wikidata knowledge base (Vrande\u010di\u0107 and Kr\u00f6tzsch, 2014).\nIndeed, KGC benchmarks extracted from Freebase like FB15K and FB15K-237 (Bordes et al., 2013; are questionable in quality. For example, FB15K was shown to have train/test leakage . Later in this paper ( \u00a7 6.2), we will show that a relatively large proportion of relations in FB15K-237 can be covered by a trivial frequency rule.\nTo address the need for a solid benchmark in KGC, we present CODEX, a set of knowledge graph COmpletion Datasets EXtracted from Wikidata and its sister project Wikipedia. Inasmuch as Wikidata is considered the successor of Freebase, CODEX improves upon existing Freebase-based KGC benchmarks in terms of scope and level of difficulty (Table 1).

While different negative sampling strategies exist (Cai and Wang, 2018), the most common approach is to randomly perturb observed triples to generate negatives, following Bordes et al. (2013).\nWhile random negative sampling is beneficial and even necessary in the case where a large number of negatives is needed (i.e., training), it is not necessarily useful for evaluation. For example, in the task of triple classification, the goal is to discriminate between positive (true) and negative (false) triples. As we show in \u00a7 5.5, triple classification over randomly generated negatives is trivially easy for state-of-the-art models because random negatives are generally not meaningful or plausible. Therefore, we generate and manually evaluate hard negatives for KGC evaluation.\nGeneration To generate hard negatives, we used each pre-trained embedding model from \u00a7 5.2 to predict tail entities of triples in CODEX. For each model, we took as candidate negatives the triples (h, r,t) for which (i) the type of the predicted tail entityt matched the type of the true tail entity t; (ii)t was ranked in the top-10 predictions by that model; and (iii) (h, r,t) was not observed in G.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Annotation", "text": "We manually labeled all candidate negative triples generated for CODEX-S and CODEX-M as true or false using the guidelines provided in Appendix C. 3 We randomly selected among the triples labeled as false to create validation and test negatives for CODEX-S and CODEX-M, examples of which are given in Ta- 3 We are currently investigating methods for obtaining highquality crowdsourced annotations of negatives for CODEX-L. ble 3.

CODEX datasets have five such relations: diplomatic relation, shares border with, sibling, spouse, and unmarried partner. Table 4 gives the proportion of triples containing symmetric relations per dataset.

To identify compositional paths, we use the AMIE3 system (Lajus et al., 2020), which outputs rules with confidence scores that capture how many times those rules are seen versus violated, to identify paths of lengths two and three; we omit longer paths as they are relatively costly to compute. We identify 26, 44, and 93 rules in CODEX-S, CODEX-M, and CODEX-L, respectively, with average confidence (out of 1) of 0.630, 0.556, and 0.459.

The goal is of link prediction is to rank true triples (\u0125, r, t) or (h, r,t) higher than false and unseen triples.\nLink prediction performance is evaluated with mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and hits@k. MRR is the average reciprocal of each ground-truth entity's rank over all (?, r, t) and (h, r, ?) test triples. Hits@k measures the proportion of test triples for which the ground-truth entity is ranked in the top-k predicted entities. In computing these metrics, we exclude the predicted entities for which (\u0125, r, t) \u2208 G or (h, r,t) \u2208 G so that known positive triples do not artificially lower ranking scores. This is called \"filtering\" (Bordes et al., 2013).\nTriple classification Given a triple (h, r, t), the goal of triple classification is to predict a corresponding label y \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. Since knowledge graph embedding models output real-valued scores for triples, we convert these scores into labels by selecting a decision threshold per relation on the validation set such that validation accuracy is maximized for the model in question.

We compare results on three sets of evaluation negatives: (1) We generate one negative per positive by replacing the positive triple's tail entity by a tail entity t sampled uniformly at random;\n(2) We generate negatives by sampling tail entities according to their relative frequency in the tail slot of all triples; and (3) We use the CODEX hard negatives.

To this end we use the PyTorch-based LibKGE framework for training and selecting knowledge graph embeddings. 4 In the remainder of this section we outline the most important parameters of our model selection process.  Training negatives Given a set of positive training triples {(h, r, t)}, we compare three types of negative sampling strategy implemented by LibKGE: (a) NegSamp, or randomly corrupting head entities h or tail entities t to create negatives; (b) 1vsAll, or treating all possible head/tail corruptions of (h, r, t) as negatives, including the corruptions that are actually positives; and (c) KvsAll, or treating batches of head/tail corruptions not seen in the knowledge graph as negatives.\nLoss functions We consider the following loss functions: (i) MR or margin ranking, which aims to maximize a margin between positive and negative triples; (ii) BCE or binary cross-entropy, which is computed by applying the logistic sigmoid to triple scores; and (iii) CE or cross-entropy between the softmax over the entire distribution of triple scores and the label distribution over all triples, normalized to sum to one.\nSearch strategies We select models using the Ax platform, which supports hyperparameter search using both quasi-random sequences of generated configurations and Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian processes. 5 At a high level, for each dataset and model, we generate both quasirandom and BO trials per negative sampling and loss function combination, ensuring that we search over a wide range of hyperparameters for different types of training strategy.

We find that ComplEx is the best at modeling symmetry and antisymmetry, and indeed it was designed specifically to improve upon bilinear models that do not capture symmetry, like DistMult (Trouillon et al., 2016). As such, it performs the best on CODEX-S, which has the highest proportion of symmetric relations. For example, on the most frequent symmetric relation (diplomatic relation), ComplEx achieves 0.859 MRR, compared to 0.793 for ConvE, 0.490 for RESCAL, and 0.281 for TransE. By contrast, TuckER is strongest at modeling compositional relations, so it performs best on CODEX-L, which has a high degree of compositionality. For example, on the most frequent compositional relation in CODEX-L (languages spoken, written, or signed), TuckER achieves 0.465 MRR, compared to 0.464 for RESCAL, 0.463 for ConvE, 0.456 for ComplEx, and 0.385 for TransE. By contrast, since CODEX-M is mostly asymmetric and non-compositional, ComplEx performs best because of its ability to model asymmetry.\nEffect of hyperparameters As shown by Figure 1, hyperparameters have a strong impact on link prediction performance: Validation MRR for all models varies by over 30 percentage points depending on the training strategy and input configuration. This finding is consistent with previous observations in the literature (Kadlec et al., 2017;Ruffinelli et al., 2020). Appendix F provides the best configurations for each model. Overall, we find that the choice of loss function in particular significantly impacts model performance. Each model consistently achieved its respective peak performance with cross-entropy (CE) loss, a finding which is corroborated by several other KGC comparison papers (Kadlec et al., 2017;Ruffinelli et al., 2020;Jain et al., 2020).

Evidently, triple classification on randomly generated negatives is a nearly-solved task. On negatives generated uniformly at random, performance scores are nearly identical at almost 100% accuracy.

Relative performance also varies: In contrast to our link prediction task in which ComplEx and TuckER were by far the strongest models, RESCAL is slightly stronger on the CODEX-S hard negatives, whereas ConvE performs best on the CODEX-M hard negatives. These results indicate that triple classification is indeed a distinct task that requires different architectures and, in many cases, different training strategies (Appendix F).\nWe believe that few recent works use triple classification as an evaluation task because of the lack of true hard negatives in existing benchmarks. Early works reported high triple classification accuracy on sampled negatives (Socher et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2014), perhaps leading the community to believe that the task was nearly solved.

In evaluating our baseline, we follow LibKGE's protocol for breaking ties in ranking (i.e., for entities that appear with equal frequency) by taking the mean rank of all entities with the same score.\nSetup We compare our baseline to the best pretrained embedding model per dataset: RESCAL for FB15K-237, which was released by Ruffinelli et al. (2020), and ComplEx for CODEX-M. We evaluate performance with MRR and Hits@10. Beyond overall performance, we also compute per-relation improvement of the respective embedding over our baseline in terms of percentage points MRR.

Furthermore, text can be used for few-shot link prediction, an emerging research direction (Xiong et al., 2017;Shi and Weninger, 2017).\nOverall, we hope that CODEX will provide a boost to research in KGC, which will in turn impact many other fields of artificial intelligence.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "A Literature review", "text": "Table 8 provides an overview of knowledge graph embedding papers with respect to datasets and evaluation tasks.

If you are not able to find any reliable, specific, clear information supporting the claim, choose false. You may explain your reasoning if need be or provide sources to back up your answer in the optional explanation column.\nExamples False triples may have problems with grammar, factual content, or both. Examples of grammatically incorrect triples are those whose entity or relation types do not make sense, for example:\n\u2022 (United States of America, continent, science fiction writer)\n\u2022 (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, medical condition, British Raj)\n\u2022 (Canada, foundational text, Vietnamese cuisine)\nExamples of grammatically correct but factually false triples include:\n\u2022 (United States of America, continent, Europe)\n\u2022 (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, country of citizenship, Argentina)\n\u2022 (Canada, foundational text, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire)\n\u2022 (Alexander Pushkin, influenced by, Leo Tolstoy) -Pushkin died only a few years after Tolstoy was born, so this sentence is unlikely.\nNotice that in the latter examples, the entity types match up, but the statements are still false.\nTips For triples about people's occupation and genre, try to be as specific as possible. For example, if the triple says (<person>, occupation, guitarist) but that person is mainly known for their singing, choose false, even if that person plays the guitar. Likewise, if a triple says (<person>, genre, classical) but they are mostly known for jazz music, choose false even if, for example, that person had classical training in their childhood.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "D Embedding models", "text": "We briefly overview the five models compared in our link prediction and triple classification tasks.\nRESCAL (Nickel et al., 2011) was one of the first knowledge graph embedding models. Although it is not often used as a baseline, Ruffinelli et al. (2020) showed that it is competitive when appropriately tuned. RESCAL treats relational learning as tensor decomposition, scoring entity embeddings h, r \u2208 R de and relation embeddings R \u2208 R de\u00d7de with the bilinear form h Rt.

TransE is likely the most popular baseline for KGC tasks and the most influential of all KGC embedding papers.\nComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) uses a bilinear function to score triples with a diagonal relation embedding matrix and complex-valued embeddings. Its scoring function is re h diag(r)t , where t is the complex conjugate of t and re denotes the real part of a complex number.\nConvE (Dettmers et al., 2018) is one of the first and most popular nonlinear models for KGC. It concatenates head and relation embeddings h and r into a two-dimensional \"image\", applies a pointwise linearity over convolutional and fullyconnected layers, and multiplies the result with the tail embedding t to obtain a score. Formally, its scoring function is given as f (vec(f ([h; r] * \u03c9))W)t, where f is a nonlinearity (originally, ReLU), [h; r] denotes a concatenation and twodimensional reshaping of the head and relation embeddings, \u03c9 denotes the filters of the convolutional layer, and vec denotes the flattening of a two-dimensional matrix.\nTuckER (Balazevic et al., 2019b) is a linear model based on the Tucker tensor decomposition, which factorizes a tensor into three lower-rank matrices and a core tensor. The TuckER scoring function for a single triple (h, r, t) is given as W \u00d7 1 h \u00d7 2 r \u00d7 3 t, where W is the mode-three core tensor that is shared among all entity and relation embeddings, and \u00d7 n denotes the tensor product along the nth mode of the tensor. TuckER can be seen as a generalized form of other linear KGC embedding models like RESCAL and ComplEx.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "E Content comparison", "text": "We provide additional comparison of the contents in CODEX-M and FB15K-237.

FB15K-237 is also much more biased toward the United States in particular, as five of its top-30 entities are specific to the US: United States of America, United States dollar, New York City,  Figure 6 compares the top-15 entity types in CODEX-M and FB15K-237.

Tables 14 and 15 report the best hyperparameter configurations for triple classification on the hard negatives in CODEX-S and CODEX-M, respectively.\nTerminology For embedding initialization, Xv refers to Xavier initialization (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). The reciprocal relations model refers to learning separate relation embeddings for queries in the direction of (h, r, ?) versus (?, r, t) (Kazemi and Poole, 2018). The frequency weighting regularization technique refers to regularizing embeddings by the relative frequency of the corresponding entity or relation in the training data.\nSearch strategies Recall that we select models using Ax, which supports hyperparameter search using both quasi-random sequences of generated configurations and Bayesian optimization (BO). The search strategy for each CODEX dataset is as follows:\n\u2022 CODEX-S: Per negative sampling type/loss combination, we generate 30 quasi-random trials followed by 10 BO trials. We select the best-performing model by validation MRR over all such combinations. In each trial, the model is trained for a maximum of 400 epochs with an early stopping patience of 5. We also terminate a trial after 50 epochs if the model does not reach \u2265 0.05 MRR.\n\u2022 CODEX-M: Per negative sampling type/loss combination, we generate 20 quasi-random trials. The maximum number of epochs and early stopping criteria are the same as for CODEX-S.\n\u2022 CODEX-L: Per negative sampling type/loss combination, we generate 10 quasi-random trials of 20 training epochs instead of 400. We reduce the number of epochs to limit resource usage. In most cases, MRR plateaus after 20-30 epochs, an observation which is consistent with (Ruffinelli et al., 2020). Then, we take the best-performing model by validation MRR over all such combinations, and retrain that model for a maximum of 400 epochs.\nNote that we search using MRR as our metric, but the triple classification task measures 0/1 accuracy, not ranking performance. For triple classification, we choose the model with the highest validation accuracy among the pre-trained models across all negative sampling type/loss function combinations.
