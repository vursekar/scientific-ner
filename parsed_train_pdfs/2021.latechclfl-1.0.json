Oh well: maybe next year we will go back to the (new) normal. Looking at submission numbers, this year's edition of the workshop was a huge success. We have received really unusually many submissions (thanks, everyone!). Out of those, we have accepted 22 papers for a 38 % acceptance rate. A round of applause for our wonderful program committee! The workshop programme consists of brief eight-minute Q&A sessions for ten oral presentations (which you will have watched by then!), and a twelve-poster session during which you will be able to chat with any author you like. Thematically, the papers cover the entire range of \"Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, Humanities and Literature\". The programme shows that this area of applied language technology is mature and active. Last but not least, Sara Tonelli will give a live invited talk. We are grateful, and we look forward to it.", "sections": [{"heading": "Invited Talk", "text": "Dissecting offensive language detection: does it work, and what can we do with it? Social media messages are often written to attack specific groups of users based on their religion, ethnicity or social status, and they can be particularly threatening to vulnerable users such as teenagers. It is therefore very important to develop reliable, unbiased and robust detection systems to support stakeholders in fighting online hatred. Although state-of-the-art systems yield very good classification results, the problem is far from being solved. In my talk, I will discuss which issues still affect the development of abusive language detection systems, for example the problem of dealing with annotators' disagreement in the creation of training data, and the issues related to contextual information in threads. On the other hand, I will show how the output of offensive language detection systems can be integrated with network-based information to study the behavioral patterns of different types of users, also in relation to misinformation.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "About the speaker", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sara Tonelli Digital Humanties Fondazione Bruno Kessler Trento, Italy", "text": "Sara Tonelli holds a PhD in Language Sciences from Universit\u00e0 Ca' Foscari, Venice.
