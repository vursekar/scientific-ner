However, domain transfer of NER models with data from multiple genres has not been widely studied. To this end, we conduct NER experiments in three predictive setups on data from: a) multiple domains; b) multiple domains where the genre label is unknown at inference time; c) domains not encountered in training. We introduce a new architecture tailored to this task by using shared and private domain parameters and multi-task learning. This consistently outperforms all other baseline and competitive methods on all three experimental setups, with differences ranging between +1.95 to +3.11 average F1 across multiple genres when compared to standard approaches. These results illustrate the challenges that need to be taken into account when building real-world NLP applications that are robust to various types of text and the methods that can help, at least partially, alleviate these issues.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Accurately identifying named entities and their type in texts is a key processing step for many NLP applications. Named entity recognition (NER) is an important component in several tasks including named entity linking (Cucerzan, 2007), co-reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002), question answering (Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2015), relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and usually sits upstream of analytics such as sentiment (Pang and Lee, 2004) or stance (Mohammad et al., 2016). Building robust NER models to accurately tag and adapt to heterogeneous types of text is thus paramount. Recent research focused on improving the overall performance of NER models on specific data sets. Yet NER models show relatively high variance even when trained on the same data (Reimers and Gurevych, 2017) and poorly generalize when tested on data from different genres 1 , especially if these contain entity mentions unseen in the test data (Augenstein et al., 2017;Agarwal et al., 2020).\nDespite this, research on NER models robust to different types of input is usually limited to the standard domain adaptation scenario: a single source domain rich in training data and a single target domain with limited or no training data (Lin and Lu, 2018). We argue that this is an over-simplified experimental setup that is not typical for how NER models are used in real-world applications. Ideally, NER models use all available data, regardless of genre, and perform inference on data from any genre, even if this was not encountered in training. In this scenario, simply pooling all the available data is likely sub-optimal as genre-specific differences in named entity mentions are useful to model. Conversely, models limited to only data from the same genre as the test set are likely to underperform, as using more data is usually beneficial.\nThis work introduces three experimental setups for the NER task where models are trained on data from multiple genres and evaluated as follows: a) Multi-Domain -evaluation is performed across multiple genres, all seen in training. b) Multi-Domain with Unknown Domain Labels -evaluation is carried out across multiple genres, all seen in training, but the genre label for each document is unknown at inference time. c) Zero-shot Domain -evaluation is performed on documents from genres unseen in training.\nWe propose a neural architecture for NER tailored to these three experimental setups, based on the popular BiLSTM-CRF architecture (Lample et al., 2016). We augment the base architecture to learn both domain-specific and independent features through shared and private domain components including projections and CRFs. Further, we add a multi-task learning objective for domain prediction to guide this separation. This model can perform inference on a text without knowledge of its corresponding domain label by using the shared components. We compare this model with several competitive methods that use a similar base architecture while holding the embeddings constant (i.e. GloVe embeddings). These include models trained on data from each domain independently, models that pool all data and models that use domain identities as features through to source-target domain adaptation methods.\nExtensive results on all three experimental setups on a collection of data from a total of twelve genres demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms all others by a respectable margin. Finally, through an error analysis of our results, we aim to understand the contributions of each proposed component and the margins for future improvements.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Setups for Domain Adaptation Domain adaptation, formulated as learning a single model for the same task across multiple domains, is a wellstudied research area in NLP (Chelba and Acero, 2004;Florian et al., 2004;Blitzer et al., 2006;Daum\u00e9 III, 2007). The standard setup for domain adaptation is to maximize performance on data from a single low-resource (target) domain, by using data from a single high-resource (source) domain (Blitzer et al., 2007;Peng and Dredze, 2017). Extensions consider a single source and multiple different target domains (Yang and Eisenstein, 2015) or multiple sources and a single target domain (Mansour et al., 2009). The multi-domain text classification task studied in (Li and Zong, 2008;Wu and Huang, 2015;Chen and Cardie, 2018) is the analogous setup for the text classification task to the first experimental setup we propose for NER. Under this setup, training and evaluation is done across data from multiple domains. Multi-Domain Adaptation Methods for multidomain text classification use data fusion either at the feature or classifier level (Li and Zong, 2008), decomposing the classifier into a shared one and multiple domain-specific ones (Wu and Huang, 2015), further guided by a domain discriminator (Chen and Cardie, 2018) which is also used in multi-lingual NER (Chen et al., 2019). Further, Mc-Closky et al. (2010) explored sequence tagging tasks on data from unknown domains and Chen and Cardie (2018) experiment with sentiment classification on data from unknown domains, similar to our third experimental setup for NER. To the best of our knowledge, our second setup where the domain label is not available at inference time was never explicitly studied. We note that most of these approaches make use of additional unlabeled data from each domain to learn domain-specific representations. We do not use these resources in our methods, as we assume the end-user of the model is agnostic to the data used in training and wants to run inference without having to provide entire comparable corpora. Domain Adaptation for NER Models for domain adaptation in NER using neural architectures were studied recently, albeit mostly for covering the single-source and single-target setup. The INIT method trains a model using the source domain data, and its parameters are used to initialize a target model which is fine-tuned on the target data (Mou et al., 2016). The MULT method trains jointly one model for each domain with shared parameters . For sequence tagging, one CRF for each of the two domains is used to obtain the predictions (Yang et al., 2017). Adaptation can also be made at the embeddings stage (Lin and Lu, 2018) or by using additional unlabeled data from the source domain and out-of-domain annotated data (He and Sun, 2017). However, as mentioned above, this assumes that unlabeled training data can be provided for each domain, which may not be realistic. The model adds layers between embeddings and the BiLSTM layers, between the BiL-STM and the CRF for the target domain and separate CRF layers, the latter two of which we adapt to our proposed architecture for multi-domain adaptation. A hierarchical Bayesian prior approach is used in (Finkel and Manning, 2009) to tie feature weights across domains when information is sparse and also allow the model to take advantage if substantial data is available in one domain. Their experiments on NER focused only on three data sets: CoNLL, MUC-6 and MUC-7 and only the first of our three setups. A multi-task domain adaptation method for NER and word segmentation is used in (Peng and Dredze, 2017). The proposed architecture learns a shared representation across domains and experiments with linear domain projections for each domain to guide learning of shared representations. The output of these linear layers is fed to a CRF. We adopt the linear domain projection method, but extend this to also include a shared projection, followed by domain-specific CRFs and multi-task learning. Finally, another type of domain adaptation is temporal adaptation of models tested on data that is more recent than the training data, when each temporal slice can be considered as a different domain (Rijwhani and Preo\u0163iuc-Pietro, 2020).", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "This section describes the proposed NER architecture tailored the architecture to our multi-domain experimental setups, which is independent of input embedding representation.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Base Architecture", "text": "The basic component of our NER models is an architecture which has reached state-of-the-art performance several times over the last few years (Lample et al., 2016;Peters et al., 2018;Akbik et al., 2018). Named entity recognition task is a structured prediction task and earlier statistical approaches are based models like Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), which rely on features often designed based on domain-specific knowledge (Luo et al., 2015). The current dominant approach to the NER task consists of neural architectures based on recurrent neural networks with different choices of input representations Ma and Hovy, 2016;Lample et al., 2016;Peters et al., 2018;Akbik et al., 2018Akbik et al., , 2019.\nThe input consists of a concatenation of pretrained word embeddings and character embeddings. Character embeddings are trained using an LSTM from randomly initialized vectors as in (Lample et al., 2016). Word embeddings are derived from a combination GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) and FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017) pre-trained word embeddings, as used in (Ma and Hovy, 2016). The choice of embeddings is orthogonal to the architecture and thus, we hold these constant in all experiments.\nThis representation is passed through two LSTM layers that process the input sequence in differ-  . The outputs of these layers are concatenated and, in order to map the word representation obtained from the LSTM module into the label distribution, passed to a one-layer feed-forward network. A Conditional Random Field is applied to the class predictions to jointly assign the sequence tags using a transition matrix. This CRF layer improves performance of the model (Lample et al., 2016) as it ensures the output sequence takes into account dependencies between the tags and also models the constraints the output sequence adheres to (e.g. I-PER can not follow B-LOC).", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Proposed Architecture (MultDomain-SP-Aux)", "text": "We propose a new architecture based on the BiLSTM-CRF model tailored to the three proposed experimental setups. Our proposed architecture enhances the base architecture with three components: a) domain -specific and -independent feed-forward layers that process the BiLSTM outputs; b) domain -specific and -independent feed forward layers CRFs; c) a multi-task learning objective that learns domain labels as an auxiliary task.\nThe proposed architecture changes are motivated by the aim of capturing commonalities in which named entities are referred to, in any given genre, while still allowing for the model to tease apart and exploit domain-specific aspects. The architecture is also designed to capture these commonalities across label relationships, which can vary across domains. In addition, the multi-task objective further assists the model to leverage domaindependent and -independent components. The choice of input representation is orthogonal to the proposed architecture and our extensions to the architecture can be combined with any input repre-sentation.\nThe model architecture is presented in Figure 1 and described below: Private and Shared Layers We rely on the shared-private paradigm where the model learns both a shared representation across all domains and is useful when the domain of the input is unknown or unseen in training, and a private domain representation that mostly helps tagging in that domain.\nWe model the shared and private features at both the feature mapping stage connecting the BiLSTM outputs to the CRF(s) and at the CRF level. We expect the features extracted by the BiLSTM layers to model the structure of the input across all domains. The feed-forward layers capture the domainspecific and -independent information by using private output layers for each domain and one shared output layer. In training, the BiLSTM outputs are projected to both the shared layer and the private layer based on the domain label provided in training. The CRF layer is used to make a global decision for the entire tag sequence by modelling label dependencies. We expect that this decision is, at least partially, dependent on domain-specific relationships in the label space. Hence, each feedforward layer feeds into either private CRFs (one for each domain) or a shared CRF. The separation of the shared and private layers could happen before the CRF stage (late separation) or before the feed-forward layer stage (early separation). We investigate the influence of each individual addition on the multi-domain performance in our analysis section through ablation studies.\nGiven an input, both the shared and the private parameters are used in learning to predict the output. The set of private parameters for each domain are only updated by data from the same domain while the set of shared parameters are updated in a pooled way by taking all available data points in the training stage regardless of the domain characteristics. For a given data point, inference can be run either by: a) passing it though the private components if the domain label is known; b) through the shared components if the domain label in unknown or the domain of the data is unseen in training. To this end, the objective function for the private and shared layers is:\nLNER SP (x, y) = LNER S (x, y) + LNER P (x, y) (1)\nwhere L N ER S and L N ER P stand for the shared layer loss and private layer loss respectively.\nMulti-Task Learning of Domain Labels Further, to better guide the learning process, we augment our architecture with a multi-task learning objective. Through this, the model learns to predict the domain label of each sample in training as an auxiliary task. The architecture uses average pooling on BiLSTM outputs followed by a fully connected layer. Finally, softmax is applied over the learned domain feature to obtain a probability distribution of all domain labels. The domain classification objective is to minimize the crossentropy loss L domain (x, y d ) for an input x with domain label y d . The global objective function is the combination of the NER loss function and domain loss:\nL(x; y, y d ) = LNER SP (x, y) + L domain (x, y d ) (2)\n4 Experimental setup", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "We use a collection of data sets spanning eight genres to evaluate our methods.

These methods focus on different variations of the neural model architecture, while holding the input embeddings constant.\nInDomain trains an individual NER model using the base architecture for each of the known domains. In inference, the corresponding in-domain model is used. This allows us to establish the baseline individual domain performance when no information is shared between the domains in training.\nInDomain-DomainClassifier uses the same NER models as the InDomain model. The In-Domain approach is however unable to directly perform inference on sentences where the domain label is unknown at inference time. We thus build a separate domain classifier using a Bi-LSTM recurrent neural network that feeds the final hidden state into a feed-forward network to recognize the domain of a given input sentence and route it to the appropriate InDomain NER model.\nPoolDomain naively pools all available data, disregarding the domain information and trains a model using the base architecture. This model thus ignores the domain information when training, albeit uses all available training data. Data pooling is the standard baseline in most domain adaptation experiments.\nPoolDomain-Init uses all available data and uses the domain information to train models on data from one domain at once. After training on data from each domain, the model uses the weights as initialization for training on next domain. This is similar to the INIT strategy for domain adaptation used in (Mou et al., 2016;. We perform this weight initialization and fine-tuning process over all the domains consecutively, where the order is defined by the density of entities, starting with the highest one.\nPoolDomain-GradRev trains the base architecture using a gradient reversal layer (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2014). The gradient reversal technique aims to confuse the domain discriminator while learning NER with the combination of the training data from all domains.\nPoolDomain+DomainFeat trains a base architecture model over all available data and, in addition to the text-based features, the domain information is explicitly represented by passing it through a domain embedding. This is appended to the word-level features that are used as input to the BiLSTM layers. The domain embeddings are randomly initialized.\nMultDomain-SP extends the MULT method (Yang et al., 2017) to the multi-domain setup. This method uses a domain-specific CRF for each domain and a shared CRF for all domains. Both the BiLSTM and the feed-forward layers are shared across all domains.

These include learning from data in multiple domains and testing on all domains, when the domain label of the test point is unknown and when this does not belong to a domain seen in training. Building on past research, we proposed a new neural architecture that achieves substantial improvements of up to 5 F1 points when compared to standard methods. Future work will focus on domain adaptation at the embedding layer. Finally, we plot the domain prediction distribution on the zero-shot genre data in Figure 3. We find that similar to the confusion matrices, the oracle strategy has a more even spread in domain selection. We observe similar patterns to the confusion matrices for the InDomain+DomainClassifier and MultDomain-SP-Aux models.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "A Domain Prediction", "text": "We further study the domains that are selected by the methods above by creating confusion matrices between the domain predictions of three setups: domain classification, domain prediction in the proposed MultDomain-SP-Aux model and the oracle in-domain choice on gold data. Figure 2 shows that the Oracle model relies on the corresponding InDomain model to only a limited extent for each model. In uniformly many cases, predictions from other in-domain models are better than the existing in-domain one, showing the variability of the NER models. The domain classifier predictions align closer to the actual domains. The MultDomain-SP-Aux model also tends to predict the domain correctly, but we see that it better learns the NW, WB and BN domains. Note noting that the MultDomain-SP-Aux model does not use these domain predictions in inference and the model uses the shared components for unknown domains or", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}], "references": [{"title": "Interpretability analysis for named entity recognition to understand system predictions and how they can improve", "journal": "ArXiv", "year": "2004", "authors": "Oshin Agarwal;
