- 2016 Task 5 : SVM and CRF for Aspect Detection and Unsupervised Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis
This paper describes in detail the approach carried out by the GTI research group for Se - mEval 2016
Task 5 : Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis , for the different subtasks proposed , as well as languages and dataset contexts .
In particular , we developed a system for category detection based on SVM .
Then for the opinion target detection task we developed a system based on CRFs .
Both are built for restaurants domain in English and Spanish languages .
Finally for aspect - based sentiment analysis we carried out an unsupervised approach based on lexicons and syntactic dependencies , in English language for laptops and restaurants domains .
In the last years , with the growth of Internet , people use it as a means of expressing their opinions and experiences about several subjects .
That is the reason why there is a great amount of user generated information available online , through many different platforms , such as blogs , social networks , etc .
This information became very valuable for companies , politicians , etc . , who are interested in what users say about them or their products .
Due to this , Sentiment Analysis ( SA ) techniques have attracted the interest of researches , trying to process all this amount of information by means of usually supervised methods based on classifiers . 
Most of these researches focus on extracting the sentiment of a whole review or text ( Liu , 2012 ) .
This is enough for many applications and purposes .
However , sometimes there is a need for analysing the text in a deeper way , at entity or aspect level .
For example , a review in the restaurants domain can include different opinions about different aspects , such as the service or the food quality , so it is interesting to distinguish the different opinions for each of these aspects .
This is the reason why some studies emerged about the so - called aspect - based sentiment analysis ( Marcheggiani et al , 2014 ; Lu et al , 2011 ) . 
Hence this is the subject of the task 5 of the Se - mEval 2016 ( Pontiki et al , 2016 ) , divided into different subtasks .
Groups are asked to detect aspect categories in a review or sentence , which are predefined for each domain and formed by an entity and an attribute .
Then , there is a subtask which consists of detecting the opinion target expression , which are related to the categories found .
Finally , aspect - based sentiment analysis is required for one of the subtasks , associating a polarity , which can be positive , negative or neutral , to each of the categories found in the sentence or review .
Datasets in different languages and domains are available for proving the approaches . 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows .
In Section 2 we make a description of the system developed for all the subtasks .
Section 3 contains the results of all the different subtasks , as well as detailed scores for each slot .
Finally , in section 4 we summarize the main aspects of our system and extract some final conclusions .
In this section we make a brief description of the system submitted for the different subtasks .
We presented our submission for English restaurants dataset for subtask 1 , slots 1 , 2 and 3 , and subtask 2 , slots 1 and 3 .
For English laptops dataset we sent a submission for subtasks 1 and 2 only in slot 3 .
Then , the system was also developed for Spanish language and restaurants dataset in subtasks 1 , slots 1 and 2 and subtask 2 , slot 1 .
In the next subsections we describe the different stages carried out for obtaining all the different results .
As a first step for all the subtasks , each preprocessed social media review must first be broken into tokens , in order to derive the syntactic context .
Partof - speech ( POS ) tagging and lemmatization are performed to ensure that all the inflected forms of a word are covered .
In the case of English , Stanford Tagger is applied due to its better results , however it does not provide lemmatization .
That is why using the resulting form and tag , lemma is extracted by means of Freeling Tagger ( Atserias et al , 2006 ; Padró and Stanilovsky , 2012 ) .
On the other hand , for Spanish language only Freeling Tagger is used .
Freeling is a library that provides multiple languages among which are English and Spanish .
Food and drinks recognition is also performed , based on dictionaries 1 , in order to identify words referring to those topics for the subsequent processing of the sentences . 
POS tagging allows the identification of lexical items that can contribute to the correct recognition of targets in a message .
These items are namely adjectives , adverbs , verbs and nouns .
The lemmatized and POS - annotated messages are fed to a parser that transforms the output of the tagger into a full parse tree .
Finally , the tree is converted to dependencies , and the functions are annotated .
The entire process is performed by means of Freeling Parser ( Padró and Stanilovsky , 2012 ) .
Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) 
This subtask contains different slots , having participated in three of them , which are slot 1 , slot 2 and slot 3 .
The system for Spanish and English language is exactly the same for both slots 1 and 2 . 1 Taken from the lists available at https://es.speaklanguages.com/inglés/vocabulario/comidas
The aim of this task is to assign to each sentence a category , which is a tuple ( entity , attribute ) , from a given set of 12 different predefined categories .
To do this , we used a linear SVM classifier combined with word lists .
These word lists are created from the training file provided by the organization , which was composed of 2000 sentences , grouped in 350 reviews .
Different datasets were provided for several languages and topics .
Our system was developed for restaurants dataset , both in English and Spanish . 
The library libsvm ( Chang and Lin , 2011 ) was used to implement the SVM classifier , using the following features for each sentence : Words : those words appearing in the sentence , which are nouns , verbs or adjectives are extracted . 
Lemmas : lemmas from nouns , verbs and adjectives are selected . 
POS tags : part of speech from nouns , verbs and adjectives in the sentence . 
Bigrams : all the bigrams found in the sentence . 
We developed 12 different binary classifiers , one for each possible category .
If the output of one classifier for a particular sentence is " 1 " , then we add the related category to the sentence .
If more than one category is found for the same sentence , we add all of them to the list of categories .
After this , the outputs are improved by means of our word lists , as we can see in Algorithm 1 , executed for each sentence .
The word lists were created automatically from the training file , extracting all the nouns and adjectives appearing in sentences from the same category , and manually filtered later in order to remove noisy items .
Six different lists are composed , containing terms related to : ambience , service , prices , quality , style options and location . 
The inputs defined for the following algorithm are the list of categories obtained from SVM for each sentence ( CList ( s ) ) and the six word lists created previously .
The output is the new list per sentence , containing the old categories from SVM and the new ones added .
For this slot , teams were asked to extract the exact expressions or words in the sentence , in which an opinion is expressed .
The implementation for this slot is made by means of CRFs , using CRF++ tool ( Kudo , 2005 ) and the training file provided for building the model .
A training file is needed to build as input for the CRF , whose structure is as follows . 
In the first column , all the words for every sentence are written , then in the second column , the corresponding lemma .
The third column represents the tag and the last one represents if the word is an aspect or not or if it is included in a multiword aspect . 
Then for creating the model we take into account all these features , as well as all the possible bigrams in each sentence .
In the output , if no target is found , no opinion is returned for that sentence .
This slot is implemented only for English language , both restaurants and laptops datasets .
Our system is fully unsupervised , this can explain the low results obtained for this slot .
An adjustment was made to the system already implemented for sentiment analysis in the whole sentence , which was presented in Semeval 2015 , task 10 : sentiment analysis in Twitter ( Fernández - Gavilanes et al , 2015 ) , which was also unsupervised .
For this dataset , a new polarity lexicon was generated automatically from the training dataset , applying a polarity rank algorithm , as explained in the mentioned article .
Then , it was merged with SOCAL ( Taboada et al , 2011 ) and AFINN ( Nielsen , 2011 ) lexicons , which are general context ones , by applying an average for those words which appeared in more than one of them . 
Our system for the restaurant dataset implements the following syntactic rules : If there is no opinion or only one target expression in the sentence , the system automatically takes the polarity of the whole sentence and assign it to all the categories which appear in this sentence .
If there is only one different target expression but appearing more than once , we check if there is an adversative clause in the sentence built with " but " particle .
If not , we also take the polarity of the whole sentence for all the opinions .
If the previous condition is fulfilled , we will take the polarity of the first clause of the sentence , which is the piece of sentence placed before the " but " and then apply a polarity linear system , which consists of summing up all the polarities found in the dictionary created .
For the next opinions which have the same target , we will follow the same procedure but with the piece of sentence after the " but " .
For this linear approach , we take negations in account only for adjectives , flipping the polarity of the adjectives which come inmediately after a negation particle , as " no " or " not " .
When there are several different opinion targets , we split the sentence to detect the scope of each target and apply the same linear polarity algorithm explained in the previous point . 
To detect the scope of the target , we take the words which appear before and after the target , splitting by punctuation marks ( " ; " , " , " , " . " , " ? " , " ! " , " - " ) . 
For the laptops dataset , since there are no opinion target expressions , we take the polarity of the whole sentence to assign the polarity of each category .
Subtask 2 is similar to subtask 1 , but instead of implementing aspect detection at sentence - level , it is performed at text - level .
Participants are asked to implement slots 1 and 3 for this subtask .
We participate in slot 1 for Spanish and English language , following the same procedure for both .
Slot 3 is just implemented for English language for restaurants and laptops datasets .
Once we performed aspect category detection at sentence - level , we use this output as input for textlevel detection .
All the categories found are grouped at sentence - level and added all of them at reviewlevel .
Besides this , if RESTAURANT#GENERAL is not explicitly assigned to any sentence of the review , we add it anyway .
Similarly to slot 1 , we use the output from subtask 1 slot 3 as input for this slot .
All the polarities found are again grouped for all the sentences contained in the review and added them to text - level .
If there are different polarities for the same category , some rules are applied : if polarities are negative and neutral , negative is finally assigned ; if there are positive and neutral opinions , positive polarity is assigned ; if there are positive and negative opinions for the same category , the tag " conflict " is assigned to that category at review - level . 
Moreover , as RESTAURANT#GENERAL is compulsory for every review , if no sentence has this category assigned , we take into account all the polarities of the other categories found and then assign the polarity for this category .
Again , if there are different polarities containing positive and negative , " conflict " tag is assigned .
The same process is followed for laptops dataset , with the LAPTOPS#GENERAL category .
In this section , we describe the experiments carried out for the different subtasks and slots and the datasets provided by the organization .
These datasets are composed of several reviews , splitted in sentences , for restaurants and laptops topics .
The performance of slots 1 and 2 , for both subtasks , are measured by means of the F - score , while slot 3 is evaluated by means of the accuracy . 
Table 1 represents the precision , recall and Fscore obtained for restaurants datasets and all the slots submitted .
For English language , an unconstrained system was presented , while for Spanish language both constrained and unconstrained systems were submitted .
The constrained approaches do not need any external resources , but only the training files provided , while in the unconstrained ones , food and drinks lexicon was used in the preprocessing step for identifying different foods and drinks . 
It can be seen that there is not much difference between constrained and unconstrained systems for Spanish language , so we can assume that the recognition of different names of foods or drinks does not increase the knowledge of the classifiers , perform - ing almost equally .
Moreover , we can state that our system perfoms as well for English as for Spanish language . 
In Table 2 , the detailed scores for slot 3 are shown in English language , for restaurants dataset , likewise in Table 3
As it can be seen in Table 2 and Table 3 , the results obtained for the sentiment slot are not quite competitive with the other teams .
This can be due to the fact that our system is fully unsupervised , while the others are usually supervised systems , based on training .
Moreover , we performed a simple adaptation from our original system , made for sentiment analysis in Twitter , presented to SemEval 2015 , so there is still a lot of improvement on this field .
This paper describes the participation of the GTI group , AtlantTIC Research Center , University of Vigo , in the SemEval 2016 , Task 5 : Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis .
We developed a supervised system based on SVM classifiers for category detection , and CRFs for opinion target detection .
Then , for the aspect - based sentiment analysis we submitted a fully unsupervised system , based on syntactic dependencies and context - based polarity lexicons .
As we can see in Table 4 , competitive results were obtained for aspect and category detection , being in first position for Spanish language , both in subtask 1 and subtask 2 .
Moreover , in subtask 2 , which is aspect detection at review level , we also achieved the first position for English language in restaurants datasets .
However , our system did not perform as well as expected in slot 3 , maybe due to the fact of the lack of supervision for our model .
It results not competitive against other supervised approaches , although its main advantage is that there is no need of training sets , which is time and resource consuming in order to manually tag them .
