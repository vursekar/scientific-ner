Estonian as a Second Language Teacher 's Tools
The paper describes " Teacher 's Tools " ( et Opetaja tööriistad ) developed by the Institute of the Estonian Language for teachers and specialists of Estonian as a Second Language .
The toolbox includes four modules : vocabulary , grammar , communicative language activities and text evaluation .
The vocabulary module provides graded word lists for young ( CEFR levels pre - A1 - C1 ) and adult ( CEFR levels A1 - C1 ) learners .
The grammar module provides descriptions of young learners ' grammar competence .
The communicative language activities module gives teachers an overview of the typical situations that learners should be able to cope with .
The text evaluation module marks lemmas in texts according to their CEFR assignment in the vocabulary module .
So far the grammar and the communicative language activities modules have been developed only for young learners ( CEFR levels pre - A1 - B2 ) .
The toolbox is aimed at providing support for the development of Estonian as an L2 courses , educational materials , exercises and tests within a CEFR - based framework .
The project started in 2017 and is ongoing .
1 Introduction " Teacher 's Tools " is a compatible toolkit developed for teachers and specialists of Estonian as a Second Language , providing an extensive overview of the development of lexical and grammatical competence in Estonian among L2 learners .
The toolkit is accessible as a sub - page of the language portal Sõnaveeb 1 .
The framework of the project is based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages : Learning , Teaching , Assessment ( CEFR , 2001 ) , its Companion Volume with New Descriptors ( CEFR / CV , 2018 ) and the Collated Representative Samples of Descriptors of Language Competences Developed for Young 1 https://sonaveeb.ee/teacher - tools Learners for Ages 7 - 10 ( Szabo , 2018a ) and 11 - 15 ( Szabo , 2018b ) .
The toolkit distinguishes between adult ( CEFR levels A1 - C1 ) and young learners ( CEFR levels pre - A1 - C1 ) .
The methodology of the project is adapted from similar projects for other languages ( e.g. Capel , 2010Capel , , 2012O'Keeffe and Geraldine 2017 ; Alfter et al , 2019 ) .
There are quite a few corpora available for the research of the Estonian Language ( the biggest Estonian corpus is the " Estonian National Corpus 2019 " ( 1 , 5 billions words ) ) 2 .
However , at the beginning of the project in 2017 there was a clear lack of resources available for the research of Estonian as an L2 .
In order to fill this gap , the Institute of Estonian Language compiled two types of corpora : 1 ) coursebook corpora and 2 ) learner corpora .
As Volodina and Kokkinakis ( 2013 ) point out , the first type of corpora provides information about what and when education professionals found important for students to learn ( passive linguistic competence ) , while learner corpora provide an indication of active linguistic competence .
Both need to be studied since the second is directly influenced by the first .
The coursebook corpora were compiled in several stages and resulted in two groups of corpora : " Estonian as a Second Language Coursebook Content Corpus 2017 " 3 ( contains eight coursebooks for adult learners at levels A1 - C1 ; 500 000 tokens ) and " Estonian as a Second Language School Coursebook Content Corpus 2021 " 4 ( contains 27 school coursebooks for grades 1 - 12 ; 1 300 000 tokens ) .
The learner corpus was compiled in 2019 - 2021 and contains 6700 Estonian as an L2 young learner 's texts .
These are texts written mostly as state standard - determining tests ( grades 3 and 6 ) , basic school final examinations The data is available for analysis through the interface of the Estonian Learner Language Corpus EMMA 5 .
The texts were not corrected or altered .
Both types of corpora were used for the development of " Teacher 's Tools " .
The coursebook corpora were used primarily to create passive vocabulary word lists and for the analysis of explicit and implicit grammar teaching .
The learner corpus was used for the creation and analysis of active vocabulary word lists and the dynamics of grammar acquisition . 
3 Modules of " Teacher 's Tools " " Teacher 's Tools " consists of four modules : vocabulary , grammar , communicative language activities and text evaluation .
The vocabulary module includes young and adult learners ' word lists compiled on the basis of coursebook and learner corpus word lists in comparison with frequency distribution in the " Estonian National Corpus 2017 " 6 .
Currently , the vocabulary list for adult learners includes about 12 500 words for levels A1 - C1 .
The young learners ' word list includes approx .
9000 words for levels pre - A1 - B2 .
All words are presented as lemmas .
Users can generate word lists based on learner type ( young or adult ) and POS .
In addition , 24 topics ( clothes , furniture , birds etc . ) are compiled .
The search results can be sorted alphabetically , by level or by POS ( see Figure 1 ) .
The grammar module is the first attempt to create a systematic overview of Estonian L2 learner 's grammar competence development .
The general methodology was adopted from the English Grammar Profile 7 project ( O'Keeffe and Geraldine , 2017 ) .
Currently , the grammar module provides descriptions of grammar competence on the morphology , derivation , phrase and sentence levels , from level pre - A1 up to level B2 ( see Figure 2 ) .
The same grammatical category ( e.g. the use of the genetive case for nouns or the use of imperative mood for verbs ) may be described at all levels , but the functions and usage ( how often the learner makes mistakes and what kinds of mistakes ) are level - specific .
Search options offer users choices of four main categories : morphology , derivation , phrase formation and sentence formation .
The main categories contain 19 subcategories .
For example , subcategories of morphology are verb , noun , adjective , numeral , pronoun , adverb .
Every subcategory has grammatical markers ( e.g. number and case for noun ) .
The grammatical markers have values , for example number has values singular and plural .
All descriptions are equipped with example sentences compiled either by experts or taken from coursebook and learner 's corpora .
The communicative language activities module is based on CEFR / CV descriptor scales , and examples are taken from Szabo ( 2018a , b ) , which include reception processes and strategies of written and spoken texts ( listening and reading ) , written and oral text production and production strategies , and written and spoken interaction and interaction strategies .
It covers young learners at levels A1 - B2 .
The architecture of the module is similar to that of the grammar module , containing main categories ( reception , production , interaction and mediation ) and subcategories , which are followed by detailed descriptions , including limitations : when and how well the language user can manage certain communicative activities ( see Figure 3 ) .
For example , by choosing the main category reception and the subcategory overall listening comprehension , a teacher can see that at the A1 level the learner should be able to understand a simple description with short sentences , for example about the weather or how big a certain object is .
The text evaluation tool helps to assess Estonian texts for their degrees of complexity according to the CERF ( see Figure 4 ) .
Currently , the tool takes into account only lexical information and defines the CEFR level of each particular lemma based on CEFR vocabulary lists ( see Chapter 3.1 ) .
Similar tools have also been developed for many other languages ( see e.g. Alfter , 2021 ) .
The program runs on EstNLTK v 1.6 , which offers functionality to lemmatise and perform morphological analysis .
The tool needs to be developed further .
First , there is a need to implement methods for the improvement of the analysis of homonyms ( for example tamm can mean either an oak or a dam , which is assigned different levels in word lists ) and multiword expressions .
So far , the analysis is based only on single word lists , which is not sufficient .
4 Summary " Teacher 's Tools " is the first attempt to provide a systematic overview of the development of lexical and grammatical competence in Estonian as a Second Language .
The project is a work in progress and further development of the toolkit is foreseen .
We plan to add descriptions of the development of grammar competence and communicative language activities for adult learners .
The enrichment of the text evaluation module with the possibility of measuring grammatical difficulty and readability ( by for example adding Lix - index value ) is under development .
" Teacher 's Tools " as a resource can be used for different CALL tasks , including auto - matic CEFR - related vocabulary and grammar exercise generation or lexical simplification tasks .
The use of NLP for the development of such computerassisted tools has enormous potential for enhancing the teaching and learning of Estonian as an L2 .
