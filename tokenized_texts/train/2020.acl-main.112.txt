Yet , manually curated lexicons are only available for a handful of languages , leaving most languages of the world without such a precious resource for downstream applications .
Even worse , their coverage is often limited both in terms of the lexical units they contain and the emotional variables they feature .
In order to break this bottleneck , we here introduce a methodology for creating almost arbitrarily large emotion lexicons for any target language .
Our approach requires nothing but a source language emotion lexicon , a bilingual word translation model , and a target language embedding model .
Fulﬁlling these requirements for 91 languages , we are able to generate representationally rich high - coverage lexicons comprising eight emotional variables with more than 100k lexical entries each .
We evaluated the automatically generated lexicons against human judgment from 26 datasets , spanning 12 typologically diverse languages , and found that our approach produces results in line with state - of - the - art monolingual approaches to lexicon creation and even surpasses human reliability for some languages and variables .

1 Introduction An emotion lexicon is a lexical repository which encodes the affective meaning of individual words ( lexical entries ) .
Most simply , affective meaning can be encoded in terms of polarity , i.e. , the distinction whether an item is considered as positive , negative , or neutral .
This is the case for many well - known resources such as WORDNET - AFFECT ( Strapparava and Valitutti , 2004 ) ,
SENTI WORDNET(Baccianella et al . , 2010 ) , or VADER ( Huttoand Gilbert , 2014 ) .
Yet , an increasing number of researchers focus on more expressive encodings for affective states inspired by distinct lines of work in psychology ( Yu et al . , 2016 ; Buechel and Hahn , 2017 ; Sedoc et al . , 2017 ; Abdul - Mageed and Ungar , 2017 ; Bostan and Klinger , 2018 ; Mohammad , 2018 ; Troiano et al . , 2019 ) .
Psychologists , on the one hand , value such lexicons as a controlled set of stimuli for designing experiments , e.g. , to investigate patterns of lexical access or the structure of memory ( Hofmann et al . , 2009 ; Monnier and Syssau , 2008 ) .
NLP researchers , on the other hand , use them to augment the emotional loading of word embeddings ( Yu et al . , 2017 ; Khosla et al . , 2018 ) , as additional input to sentence - level emotion models so that the performance of even the most sophisticated neural network gets boosted ( Mohammad and Bravo - Marquez , 2017 ; Mohammad et al . , 2018 ; De Bruyne et al . , 2019 ) , or rely on them in a keyword - spotting approach when no training data is available , e.g. , for studies dealing with historical language stages ( Buechel et al . , 2016 ) .
As with any kind of manually curated resource , the availability of emotion lexicons is heavily restricted to only a few languages whose exact number varies depending on the variables under scrutiny .
For example , we are aware of lexicons for 15 languages that encode the emotional variables of Valence , Arousal , and Dominance ( see Section 2 ) .
This number leaves the majority of the world ’s ( less - resourced ) languages without such a dataset .
In case such a lexicon exists for a particular language , it is often severely limited in size , sometimes only comprising some hundreds of entries ( Davidson and Innes - Ker , 2014 ) .
Yet , even the largest lexicons typically cover only some ten thousands of words , still leaving out major portions of the emotion - carrying vocabulary .
This is especially true for languages with complex morphology or
1203productive compounding , such as Finnish , Turkish , Czech , or German .
Finally , the diversity of emotion representation schemes adds another layer of complexity .
While psychologists and NLP researchers alike ﬁnd that different sets of emotional variables are complementary to each other ( Stevenson et al . , 2007 ; Pinheiro et al . , 2017 ; Barnes et al . , 2019 ; De Bruyne et al . , 2019 ) , manually creating emotion lexicons for every language and every emotion representation scheme is virtually impossible .
We here propose an approach based on crosslingual distant supervision to generate almost arbitrarily large emotion lexicons for any target language and emotional variable , provided the following requirements are met : a source language emotion lexicon covering the desired variables , a bilingual word translation model , and a target language embedding model .
By fulﬁlling these preconditions , we can automatically generate emotion lexicons for 91 languages covering ratings for eight emotional variables and hundreds of thousands of lexical entries each .
Our experiments reveal that our method is on a par with state - of - the - art monolingual approaches and compares favorably with ( sometimes even outperforms ) human reliability .
2 Related Work Representing Emotion .
Whereas research in NLP has focused for a very long time almost exclusively on polarity , more recently , there has been a growing interest in more informative representation structures for affective states by including different groups of emotional variables ( Bostan and Klinger , 2018 ) .
Borrowing from distinct schools of thought in psychology , these variables can typically be subdivided into dimensional vs.discrete approaches to emotion representation ( Calvo and Mac Kim , 2013 ) .
The dimensional approach assumes that emotional states can be composed out of several foundational factors , most noticeably Valence ( corresponding to polarity ) , Arousal ( measuring calmness vs. excitement ) , and Dominance ( the perceived degree of control in a social situation ) ; V AD , for short ( Bradley and Lang , 1994 ) .
Conversely , the discrete approach assumes that emotional states can be reduced to a small , evolutionary motivated set of basic emotions ( Ekman , 1992 ) .
Although the exact division of the set has been subject of hot debates , recently constructed datasets ( see Section 4 ) most often cover the categories of Joy , Anger , Sadness , Fear , and Disgust ; BE5 , forshort .
Plutchik ’s Wheel of Emotion takes a middle ground between those two positions by postulating emotional categories which are yet grouped into opposite pairs along different levels of intensity ( Plutchik , 1980 ) .
Another dividing line between representational approaches is whether target variables are encoded in terms of ( strict ) class - membership or scores for numerical strength .
In the ﬁrst case , emotion analysis translates into a ( multi - class ) classiﬁcation problem , whereas the latter turns it into a regression problem ( Buechel and Hahn , 2016 ) .
While our proposed methodology is agnostic towards the chosen emotion format , we will focus on the V AD and BE5 formats here , using numerical ratings ( see the examples in Table 1 ) due to the widespread availability of such data .
Accordingly , this paper treats word emotion prediction as a regression problem .

[ V AD ] , and Joy , Anger , Sadness , Fear , and Disgust [ BE5 ] .
V AD uses 1 - to-9 scales ( “ 5 ” encodes the neutral value ) and BE5 1 - to-5 scales ( “ 1 ” encodes the neutral value ) .
Building Emotion Lexicons .
Usually , the ground truth for affective word ratings ( i.e. , the assignment of emotional values to a lexical item ) is acquired in a questionnaire study design where subjects ( annotators ) receive lists of words which they rate according to different emotion variables or categories .
Aggregating individual ratings of multiple annotators then results in the ﬁnal emotion lexicon ( Bradley and Lang , 1999 ) .
Recently , this workﬂow has often been enhanced by crowdsourcing ( Mohammad and Turney , 2013 ) and best - worst scaling ( Kiritchenko and Mohammad , 2016 ) .
As a viable alternative to manual acquisition , such lexicons can also be created by automatic means ( Bestgen , 2008 ; K ¨oper and Schulte i m Walde , 2016 ; Shaikh et al . , 2016 ) , i.e. , by learning to predict emotion labels for unseen words .
Researchers have worked on this prediction problem for quite a long time .
Early work tended to focus on word statistics , often in combination with linguistic rules ( Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown ,
12041997 ; Turney and Littman , 2003 )
.
More recent approaches focus heavily on word embeddings , either using semi - supervised graph - based approaches ( Wang et al . , 2016 ; Hamilton et al . , 2016 ; Sedoc et al . , 2017 ) or fully supervised methods ( Rosenthal et al . , 2015 ; Li et al . , 2017 ; Rothe et al . , 2016 ; Du and Zhang , 2016 ) .
Most important for this work , Buechel and Hahn ( 2018b ) report on near - human performance using a combination of FAST TEXT vectors and a multi - task feed - forward network ( see Section 4 ) .
While this line of work can add new words , it does not extend lexicons to other emotional variables or languages .
A relatively new way of generating novel labels isemotion representation mapping ( ERM ) , an annotation projection that translates ratings from one emotion format into another , e.g. , mapping V AD labels into BE5 , or vice versa ( Hoffmann et al . , 2012 ; Buechel and Hahn , 2016 , 2018a ; Alarc ˜ao and Fonseca , 2017 ; Landowska , 2018 ;
Zhou et
al . , 2020 ; Park et
al . , 2019 ) .
While our work uses ERM to add additional emotion variables to the source lexicon , ERM alone can neither increase the coverage of a lexicon , nor adapt it to another language .
Translating Emotions .
The approach we propose is strongly tied to the observation by Leveau et al .
( 2012 ) and Warriner et al .
( 2013 ) who found — comparing a large number of existing emotion lexicons of different languages — that translational equivalents of words show strong stability and adherence to their emotional value .
Yet , their work is purely descriptive .
They do not exploit their observation to create new ratings , and only consider manual rather than automatic translation .
Making indirect use of this observation , Mohammad and Turney ( 2013 ) offer machine - translated versions of their NRC Emotion Lexicon .
Also , many approaches in cross - lingual sentiment analysis ( on the sentence - level ) rely on translating polarity lexicons ( Abdalla and Hirst , 2017 ; Barnes et al . , 2018 ) .
Perhaps most similar to our work , Chen and Skiena ( 2014 ) create ( polarity - only ) lexicons for 136 languages by building a multilingual word graph and propagating sentiment labels through that graph .
Yet , their method is restricted to high frequency words — their lexicons cover between 12 and 4,653 entries , whereas our approach exceeds this limit by more than two orders of magnitude .
Our methodology also resembles previous work which models word emotion for historical language stages ( Cook and Stevenson , 2010 ; Hamilton et al . ,2016 ;
Hellrich et al . , 2018 ; Li et al . , 2019 ) .
Work in this direction typically comes up with a set of seed words with assumingly temporally stable affective meaning ( our work assumes stability against translation ) and then uses distributional methods to derive emotion ratings in the target language stage .
However , gold data for the target language ( stage ) is usually inaccessible , often preventing evaluation against human judgment .
In contrast , we here propose several alternative evaluation set - ups as an integral part of our methodology .

A Novel Approach to Lexicon Creation Our methodology integrates ( 1 ) cross - lingual generation and expansion of emotion lexicons and ( 2 ) their evaluation against gold and silver standard data .
Consequently , a key aspect of our workﬂow design is how data is split into train , dev , and test sets at different points of the generation process .
Figure 1 gives an overview of our framework including a toy example for illustration .
Lexicon Generation .
We start with a lexicon ( Source ) of arbitrary size , emotion format1and source language which is partitioned into train , dev , and test splits denoted by Source - train , Source - dev , andSource - test , respectively .
Next , we leverage a bilingual word translation model between source and desired target language to build the ﬁrst target - side emotion lexicon denoted as TargetMT .
Source words are translated according to the model , whereas target - side emotion labels are simply copied from the source to the target ( see Section 2 ) .
Entries are assigned to train , dev , or test set according to their source - side assignment ( cf .
Figure 1 ) .
The choice of our translation service ( see below ) ensures that each source word receives exactly one translation .
TargetMT is then used as the distant supervisor to train a model that predicts word emotions based on target - side word embeddings .
TargetMT - train and TargetMT - dev are used to ﬁt model parameters and optimize hyperparameters , respectively , whereas TargetMT - test is held out for later evaluation .
Once ﬁnalized , the model is used to predict new labels for the words in TargetMT , resulting in a second target - side emotion lexicon denoted TargetPred .
Our rationale for doing so is that a reasonably trained model should generalize well 1This encompasses not only V A(D ) and BE5 , but also any sort of ( real - valued ) polarity encodings .

over the entire TargetMT lexicon because it has access to the target - side embedding vectors .
Hence , it may mitigate some of the errors which were introduced in previous steps , either by machine translation or by assuming that sourceand target - side emotion are always identical .
We validate this assumption in Section 6 .
We also predict ratings for allthe words in the embedding model , leading to a large number of new entries .
The splits are deﬁned as follows : let MT train , MT dev , and MT testdenote the set of words in train , dev , and test split of TargetMT , respectively .
Likewise , let Ptrain , Pdev , andPtestdenote the splits of TargetPred and let Edenote the set of words in the embedding model .
Then Ptrain : = MT train Pdev :
= MT devnMT train Ptest : = ( MT test[E)n(MT dev[MT train )
The above deﬁnitions help clarify the way we address polysemy.2Ambiguity on the target - side 2In short , our work evades this problem by dealing with lexical entries exclusively on the type- rather than the senselevel .
From a lexicological perspective , this may seem like a strong assumption .
From a modeling perspective , however , it appears almost obvious as it aligns well with the major components of our methodology , i.e. , lexicons , embeddings , and translation .
The lexicons we work with follow the design of behavioral experiments : a stimulus ( word type ) is given tomay result in multiple source entries translating to the same target - side word.3This circumstance leads to “ partial duplicates ” in TargetMT , i.e. , groups of entries with the same word type but different emotion values ( because they were derived from distinct Source entries ) .
Such overlap could do harm to the integrity of our evaluation since knowledge may “ leak ” from training to validation phase , i.e. , by testing the model on words it has already seen during training , although with distinct emotion labels .
The proposed data partitioning eliminates such distortion effects .
Since partial duplicates receive the same embedding vector , the prediction model assigns the same emotion value to both , thus merging them in TargetPred .
Evaluation Methodology .
The main advantage of the above generation method is that it allows us to create large - scale emotion lexicons for languages a subject and the response ( rating ) is recorded .
The absence of sense - level annotation simpliﬁes the mapping between lexicon and embedding entries .
While sense embeddings form an active area of research ( Camacho - Collados and Pilehvar , 2018 ; Chi and Chen , 2018 ) , to the best of our knowledge , type - level embeddings yield state - of - the - art performance in downstream applications .
3Source - side polysemy , in contrast to its target - side counterpart , is less of a problem , because we receive only a single candidate during translation .
This may result in cases where the translation misaligns with the copied emotion value in TargetMT .
Yet , the prediction step partly mitigates such inconsistencies ( see Section 6 ) .
1206for which gold data is lacking .
But if that is the case , how can we assess the quality of the generated lexicons ?
Our solution is to propose two different evaluation scenarios — a gold evaluation which is a strict comparison against human judgment , meaning that it is limited to languages where such data ( denoted TargetGold ) is available , and a silver evaluation which substitutes human judgments by automatically derived ones ( silver standard ) which is feasible for any language in our study .
The rationale is that if both , gold and silver evaluation , strongly agree with each other , we can use one as proxy for the other when no target - side gold data exists ( examined in Section 6 ) .
Note that our lexicon generation approach consists of two major steps , translation andprediction .
However , these two steps are not equally important for each generated entry in TargetPred .
Words , such as German Sonnenschein for which a translational equivalent already exists in the Source ( “ sunshine ” ; see Figure 1 ) , mainly rely on translation , while the prediction step acts as an optional reﬁnement procedure .
In contrast , the prediction step is crucial for words , such as Erdbeben , whose translational equivalents ( “ earthquake ” ) are missing in the Source .
Yet , these words also depend on the translation step for producing training data .
These considerations are important for deciding which words to evaluate on .
We may choose to base our evaluation on the full TargetPred lexicon , including words from the training set — after all , the word emotion model does not have access toanytarget - side gold data .
The problem with this approach is that it merges words that mainly rely ontranslation , because their equivalents are in the Source , and those which largely depend on prediction , because they are taken from the embedding model .
In this case , generalizability of evaluation results becomes questionable .
Thus , our evaluation methodology needs to fulﬁll the following two requirements : ( 1 ) evaluation must not be performed on translational equivalents of the Source entries to which the model already had access during training ( e.g. , Sonnenschein and nuklear in our example from Figure 1 ) ; but , on the other hand , ( 2 ) a reasonable number of instances must be available for evaluation ( ideally , as many as possible to increase reliability ) .
The intricate cross - lingual train - dev - test set assignment of our generation methodology is in place so that we meet these two requirements .

( 2019 ) Table 2 : Lexicons used for gold evaluation .
IDs consist of the respective ISO 639 - 1 language code plus a cardinal number to distinguish different datasets , if needed ; the format of emotion Encoding is speciﬁed and Size gives the number of lexical entries per lexicon .
In particular , for our silver evaluation , we intersect TargetMT - test with TargetPred - test and compute the correlation of these two sets individually for each emotion variable .
Pearson ’s rwill be used as correlation measure throughout this paper .
Establishing a test set at the very start of our workﬂow , Source - test , assures that there is a relatively large overlap between the two sets and , by extension , that our requirements for the evaluation are met .
The gold evaluation is a somewhat more challenging case , because we can , in general , not guarantee that the overlap of a TargetGold lexicon withTargetPred - test will be of any particular size .
For this reason , the words of the embedding model are added to TargetPred - test ( see above ) , maximizing the expected overlap withTargetGold .
In practical terms , we intersect TargetGold withTargetPred - test and compute the variable - wise correlation between these sets , in parallel to the silver evaluation .
A complementary strategy for maximizing overlap , by exploiting dependencies between published lexicons , is described below .
12074 Experimental Setup Gold Lexicons and Data Splits .
We use the English emotion lexicon from Warriner et al .
( 2013 ) as ﬁrst part of our Source dataset .
This popular resource comprises about 14k entries in V AD format collected via crowdsourcing .
Since manually gathered BE5 ratings are available only for a subset of this lexicon ( Stevenson et al . , 2007 ) , we add BE5 ratings from Buechel and Hahn ( 2018a ) who used emotion representation mapping ( see Section 2 ) to convert the existing V AD ratings , showing that this is about as reliable as human annotation .
As apparent from the previous section , a crucial aspect for applying our methodology is the design of the train - dev - test split of the Source because it directly impacts the amount of words we can test our lexicons on during gold evaluation .
In line with these considerations , we choose the lexical items which are already present in ANEW ( Bradley and Lang , 1999 ) as Source - test set .
ANEW is the precursor to the version later distributed by Warriner et
al .
( 2013 ) ; it is widely used and has been adapted to a wide range of languages .
With this choice , it is likely that a resulting TargetPred - test set has a large overlap with the respective TargetGold lexicon .
As for the TargetGold lexicons , we included every V A(D ) and BE5 lexicon we could get hold of with more than 500 entries .
This resulted in 26 datasets covering 12 quite diverse languages ( see Table 2 ) .
Note that we also include English lexicons in the gold evaluation .
In these cases , no translation will be carried out ( Source is identical to TargetMT )
so that only the expansion step is validated .
Appendix A.1 gives further details on data preparation .
Translation .
We used the GOOGLE CLOUD TRANSLATION API4to produce word - to - word translation tables .
This is a commercial service , total translation costs amount to 160 EUR .
API calls were performed in November 2019 .
Embeddings .
We use the fastText embedding models from Grave et al .
( 2018 ) trained for 157 languages on the respective WIKIPEDIA and the respective part of COMMON CRAWL .
These resources not only greatly facilitate our work but also increase comparability across languages .
The restriction to “ only ” 91 languages comes from intersecting the ones covered by the vectors with the languages covered by the translation service .
4https://cloud.google.com/translate/Models .
Since our proposed methodology is agnostic towards the chosen word emotion model , we will re - use models from the literature .
In particular , we will rely on the multi - task learning feed - forward network ( MTLFFN ) worked out by Buechel and Hahn ( 2018b ) .
This network constitutes the current state of the art for monolingual emotion lexicon creation ( expanding an existing lexicon for a given language ) for many of the datasets in Table 2 .
The MTLFFN has two hidden layers of 256 and 128 units , respectively , and takes pre - trained embedding vectors as input .
Its distinguishing feature is that hidden layer parameters are shared between the different emotion target variables , thus constituting a mild form of multi - task learning ( MTL ) .
We apply MTL to V AD and BE5 variables individually ( but not between both groups ) , thus training twodistinct emotion models per language , following the outcome of a development experiment .
Details are given in Appendix A.2 together with the remainder of the model speciﬁcations .
Being aware of the infamous instability of neural approaches ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2017 ) , we also employ a ridge regression model , an L2regularized version of linear regression , as a more robust , yet also powerful baseline ( Li et al . , 2017 ) .
5 Results The size of the resulting lexicons ( a complete list is provided in Table 8 in the Appendix ) ranges from roughly 100k to more than 2 M entries mainly depending on the vocabulary of the respective embeddings .
We want to point out that not every single entry should be considered meaningful because of noise in the embedding vocabulary caused by typos and tokenization errors .
However , choosing the “ best ” size for an emotion lexicon necessarily translates into a quality - coverage trade - off for which there is no general solution .
Instead , we release the full - size lexicons and leave it to prospective users to apply any sort of ﬁltering they deem appropriate .
Silver Evaluation .
Figure 2 displays the results of our silver evaluation .
Languages ( x - axis ) are sorted by their average performance over all variables ( not shown in the plot ; tabular data given in the Appendix ) .
As can be seen , the evaluation results for English are markedly better than for any other language .
This is not surprising since no ( potentially error - prone ) machine translation was performed .
Apart from that , performance remains relatively stable across most of the languages and
1208 Figure 2 : Silver evaluation results in Pearson ’s r. Languages ( x - axis ) are sorted according to mean correlation .
starts degrading more quickly only for the last third of them .
In particular , for Valence — typically the easiest variable to predict — we achieve a strong performance of r > : 7for 56 languages .
On the other hand , for Arousal — typically , the most difﬁcult one to predict — we achieve a solid performance ofr > : 5for 55 languages .
Dominance and the discrete emotion variables show performance trajectories swinging between these two extremes .
We assume that the main factors for explaining performance differences between languages are the quality of the translation and embedding models which , in turn , both depend on the amount of available text data ( parallel or monolingual , respectively ) .
Comparing MTLFFN and ridge baseline , we ﬁnd that the neural network reliably outperforms the linear model .
On average over all languages and variables , the MTL models achieve 6.7%-points higher Pearson correlation .
Conversely , ridge regression outperforms MTLFFN in only 15 of the total 728 cases ( 91 languages 8 variables ) .
Gold Evaluation .
Results for V AD variables on gold data are given in Table 3 .
As can be seen , our lexicons show a good correlation with human judgment and do so robustly , even for less - resourced languages , such as Indonesian ( i d ) , Turkish ( tr ) , or Croatian ( hr ) , and across affective variables .
Perhaps the strongest negative outliers are the Arousal results for the two Chinese datasets ( zh ) , which are likely to result from the low reliability of the gold ratings ( see below).ID Shared ( % ) Val Aro Dom en1 1032 100 .94(.87 ) .76(.67 ) .88(.76 )

CV ) .
We admit that those results are not fully comparable to those presented here because we use ﬁxed splits rather than 10 - CV .
Nevertheless , we ﬁnd that the results of our cross - lingual set - up are more than competitive , outperforming the monolingual results from Buechel and Hahn ( 2018b ) in 17 out of 30 cases ( mainly for Valence and Dominance , less often for Arousal ) .
This is surprising since we use an otherwise identical model and training procedure .
We conjecture that the large size of the English Source lexicon , compared to most TargetGold lexicons , more than compensates for error - prone machine translation .
Table 4 shows the results for BE5 datasets which are in line with the V AD results .
Regarding the ordering of the emotional variables , again , we ﬁnd Valence to be the easiest one to predict , Arousal the hardest , whereas basic emotions and Dominance take a middle ground .
Comparison against Human Reliability .
We base this analysis on inter - study reliability ( ISR ) , a rather strong criterion for human performance .
ISR is computed , per variable , as the correlation between the ratings from two distinct annotation studies ( Warriner et al . , 2013 ) .
Hence , this analysis is restricted to languages where more than one gold lexicon exists per emotion format .
We intersect the entries from both gold standards as well as the respective TargetPred - test set and compute the correlation between all three pairs of lexicons .
If our lexicon agrees more with one of the gold standards than the two gold standards agree with each other , we consider this as an indicator for superhuman reliability ( Buechel and Hahn , 2018b ) .
As shown in Table 5 , our lexicons are often competitive with human reliability for Valence ( especially for English and Chinese ) , but outperformGold1 Gold2 Shared Emo G1vsG2 G1vsPr G2vsPr en1 en2 1032V .953 .941

There are no cases of overlapping gold standards for BE5 .
6 Methodological Assumptions Revisited This section investigates patterns in prediction qualityacross languages , validating design decisions of our methodology .
Translation vs. Prediction .
Is it beneﬁcial to predict new ratings for the words in TargetMT rather than using them as ﬁnal lexicon entries straight away ?
For each TargetGold lexicon ( cf .
Table 2 )
, we intersect its word material with that inTargetMT andTargetPred .
Then , we compute the correlation between TargetPred and TargetMT with the gold standard .
This analysis was done on the respective train sets because using TargetMT rather than TargetPred is only an option for entries known at training time .
Table 6 depicts the results of this comparison averaged over all gold lexicons .
As hypothesized , the TargetPred lexicons agree , on average , more with human judgment than the TargetMT lexicons , suggesting that the word emotion model acts as a value - adding post - processor , partly mitigating rating inconsistencies introduced by mere translation of the lexicons .
The observation holds for each individual emotion variable with particularly large beneﬁts for Arousal , where the postprocessed TargetPred lexicons are on average

14%-points better compared to the translation - only TargetMT lexicons .
This seems to indicate that lexical Arousal is less consistent between translational equivalents compared to other emotional meaning components like Valence and Sadness , which appear to be more robust against translation .
Gold vs. Silver Evaluation .
How meaningful is silver evaluation without gold data ?
We compute the Pearson correlation between gold and silver evaluation results across languages per emotion variable .
For languages where we consider multiple datasets during gold evaluation , we ﬁrst average the gold evaluation results for each emotion variable .
As can be seen from Table 7 , the correlation values range between r=:91for Joy and r=:27for Disgust .
This relatively large dispersion is not surprising when we take into account that we correlate very small data series ( for Valence and Arousal there are just 12 languages for which both gold and silver evaluation results are available ; for BE5 there are only 5 such languages ) .
However , the mean over all correlation values in Table 7 is:64 , indicating that there is a relatively strong correlation between both types of evaluation .
This suggests that the silver evaluation may be used as a rather reliable proxy of lexicon quality even in the absence of language - speciﬁc gold data .

7 Conclusion Emotion lexicons are at the core of sentiment analysis , a rapidly ﬂourishing ﬁeld of NLP .
Yet , despite large community efforts , the coverage of existing lexicons is still limited in terms of languages , size , and types of emotion variables .
While there are techniques to tackle these three forms of sparsity in isolation , we introduced a methodology which allows us to cope with them simultaneously by jointly combining emotion representation mapping , machine translation , and embedding - based lexicon expansion .
Our study is “ large - scale ” in many respects .
We created representationally complex lexicons — comprising 8 distinct emotion variables — for 91 languages with up to 2 million entries each .
The evaluation of the generated lexicons featured 26 manually annotated datasets spanning 12 diverse languages .
The predicted ratings showed consistently high correlation with human judgment , compared favorably with state - of - the - art monolingual approaches to lexicon expansion and even surpassed human inter - study reliability in some cases .
The sheer number of test sets we used allowed us to validate fundamental methodological assumptions underlying our approach .
Firstly , the evaluation procedure , which is integrated into the generation methodology , allows us to reliably estimate the quality of resulting lexicons , even without target language gold standard .
Secondly , our data suggests that embedding - based word emotion models can be used as a repair mechanism , mitigating poor target - language emotion estimates acquired by simple word - to - word translation .
Future work will have to deepen the way we deal with word sense ambiguity by way of exchanging the simplifying type - level approach our current work is based on with a semantically more informed sense - level approach .
A promising direction would be to combine a multilingual sense inventory such as BABEL NET(Navigli and Ponzetto , 2012 ) with sense embeddings ( Camacho - Collados and Pilehvar , 2018 ) .

1216A Appendices A.1 Data Preparation The exact design of the Source train - dev - test split is as follows : All entries ( words plus ratings ) from all splits are taken from Warriner et al .
( 2013 ) .
The data was then partitioned based on the overlap with the two precursory versions by Bradley and Lang ( 1999 ) ( the original ANEW ) and Bradley and Lang ( 2010 ) ( an early extended version of ANEW roughly twice as large ) .
Source - test was built by intersecting the lexicon from Warriner et al .
( 2013 ) with the original ANEW .
A similar process was applied for Source - dev : we intersected the words from Warriner et al .
( 2013 ) and Bradley and Lang ( 2010 )
and removed the ones present inSource - test .
Lastly , Source - train is made up by all words from Warriner et al .
( 2013 ) which are neither in Source - test nor inSource - dev .
The reason why the ratings in Source are taken exclusively from Warriner et al . ( 2013 ) is that these are distributed under a more permissive license compared to their precursors .
We removed multi - token entries ( e.g. , boa constrictor ) and entries with upper case characters ( e.g. , Budweiser ) from all data splits of Source , thus restricting the lexicon to single - token , nonproper noun entries to make it more suitable for word embedding - based research .
All splits combined have 13,791 entries ( train : 11,463 , dev : 1,296 , test : 1,032 ) , thus removing less than 1 % from the original lexicon.5 Regarding the remaining gold standards , the only cases which needed additional preparation or cleansing steps were zh1 ( Yu et al . , 2016 ) andzh2 ( Yao et al . , 2017 ) .
zh1 was created and is distributed using traditional Chinese characters , whereas the embedding model by Grave et
al .
( 2018 ) employs simpliﬁed ones .
Therefore , we converted zh1 into simpliﬁed characters using GOOGLE TRANSLATE6prior to evaluation .
While manually examining the zh2 lexicon , we noticed several cases where the ratings seemed rather counter - intuitive ( e.g. , seemingly positive words which received very negative ratings ) .
We contacted the authors who conﬁrmed the problem and sent us a corrected version .
We did not ﬁnd any such problems in the second version .
We consulted 5The data split is available at :
https://github.com/ JULIELab / XANEW 6In this case the regular Web application , not the API , was used : https://translate.google.com/with a Chinese native speaker for both of these procedures regarding the zh1 andzh2 lexicons .
A.2 Model Training and Implementation Training of the MTLFFN model closely followed the procedure speciﬁed by Buechel and Hahn ( 2018b ):
For each language , the model was trained for roughly 15k iterations ( exactly 168 epochs ) with a batch size of 128 using the Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) with learning rate 10 3 , and:5dropout on the hidden layers and : 2on the input layer .
As nonlinear activation function we used leaky ReLU with “ leakage ” of 0:01 .
Embedding vectors are the only model input .
They have 300 dimensions for every language , independent of their respective training data size ( Grave et al . , 2018 ) .
Since the automatic translation of Source is not guaranteed to result in single - word translations , we use the following workaround to derive embedding vectors for multi - token translations :
If the translation as a whole can not be found in the embedding model , the multi - token term gets split up into its constituent parts , using spaces , apostrophes or hyphens as separators .
Each substring is looked up in the embedding model , the averaged vector is taken as input .
If no substring is recognized , we use the zero vector instead .
We also use the zero vector for single - token entries in TargetMT that are missing in the embeddings .
Since Buechel and Hahn ( 2018b ) considered only V AD but not BE5 datasets , we conducted a development experiment on the TargetMT - dev sets for all 91 languages where we assessed whether MTL is advantageous for BE5 variables as well , or for a combination of V AD and BE5 variables .
We found that MTL improved performance when applied separately among all V AD and BE5 variables .
Yet , when jointly learning all eight emotion variables , the results were somewhat inconclusive .
Performance increased for BE5 , but decreased for V AD .
Hence , for lexicon creation , we took a cautious approach and trained two separate models per language , one for V AD , the other for BE5 .
An analysis of MTL across V AD and BE5 is left for future work .
The MTLFFN model is implemented in PYTORCH , adapting part of the TENSORFLOW code from Buechel and Hahn ( 2018b ) .
The ridge regression baseline model is implemented with SCIKIT LEARN ( Pedregosa et al . , 2011 ) using default parameters .
