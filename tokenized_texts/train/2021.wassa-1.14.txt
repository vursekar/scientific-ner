Jessica Ouyang The University of Texas at Dallas jessica.ouyang@utdallas.edu Abstract Human language encompasses more than just text ; it also conveys emotions through tone and gestures .
We present a case study of three simple and efÔ¨Åcient Transformer - based architectures for predicting sentiment and emotion in multimodal data .
The Late Fusion model merges unimodal features to create a multimodal feature sequence , the Round Robin model iteratively combines bimodal features using cross - modal attention , and the Hybrid Fusion model combines trimodal and unimodal features together to form a Ô¨Ånal feature sequence for predicting sentiment .
Our experiments show that our small models are effective and outperform the publicly released versions of much larger , state - of - the - art multimodal sentiment analysis systems .
1 Introduction Language is composed of three different modalities : text , audio , and video .
These three modalities together make it easier for humans to convey emotion and sentiment .
Thus , a machine learning model for sentiment analysis needs to learn the features and interactions of all three modalities .
For example , a frown in the video can alter the emotion expressed in the text transcript , or audio intensity can help determine if a speaker is getting agitated .
Multimodal learning has recently received a good deal of attention from the natural language processing community
[ Sun et al . , 2016 , Chen et al . , 2018 , Liu et al . , 2018 , Pham et al . , 2019 ] .
The Transformer network [ Vaswani et al . , 2017 ] , with its self - attention modules , has achieved strong performance in multimodal learning ; attention provides a natural way to model the relationship between pairs of modalities .
In this work we investigate three small , lightweight , Transformer - based architectures for multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recog - nition .
Our Ô¨Årst model is an implementation of theLate Fusion model commonly used as a baseline system , which assigns individual Transformer blocks to each of the three modalities for feature extraction and then combines these unimodal features to learn cross - modal interactions .
The second model is an implementation of the Round Robin approach ; the model generates bimodal features by using cross - modal attention to combine pairs of modalities , one pair at a time .
Our last model is aHybrid of the early and late fusion schemes .
This model merges the features extracted using a late fusion pipeline , as well as those from an early fusion pipeline , where the three modalities are concatenated and passed through a single Transformer block for feature extraction ; .
We present experiments using these three models on three multimodal datasets : IEMOCAP
[ Busso et al . , 2008 ] , an emotion recognition dataset , and CMU - MOSI [ Zadeh et al . , 2016 ] and CMUMOSEI
[ Zadeh et al . , 2018b ] , two multimodal sentiment analysis datasets .
Our results show that our small models are competitive with state - of - the - art models that use much more complex architectures .
Our main contributions are as follows : We present three lightweight architectures for multimodal sentiment analysis that achieve comparable results to much larger , state - ofthe - art models .
We analyze the effect of removing or simplifying components of state - of - the - art multimodal architectures .
We conduct experiments on small training sets , demonstrating the ability of our lightweight architectures to leverage limited training data and computational resources .
1302 Related Work We do not give an exhaustive list of prior work in multimodal sentiment analysis , but focus on recent neural approaches that achieved state - of - the - art performance at their times of publication .
2.1 Recurrent Network Approaches The Memory Fusion Network ( MFN ) of Zadeh
et al .
[ 2018a ] uses a separate LSTM to encode each of the three modalities and then uses attention to model cross - modal interactions for different combinations of modalities .
The Recurrent Attended Variation Embedding Network ( RA VEN ) of Wang et al .
[ 2019 ] encodes the audio and video features using two recurrent neural networks ; these features are combined with the textual input using cross - modal attention in a Gated Modality Mixing Network .
The Multi - Attention Recurrent Network ( MARN ) of Zadeh et al .
[ 2018c ] is an LSTM - based architecture that stores representations of each of the three modalities , which are then combined using a multi - attention block .
Finally , the Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network ( MCTN ) of Pham et al .
[ 2019 ] produces multimodal features by translating one modality into another , learning a joint encoding in that direction , and then back - translating to learn a joint encoding in the other direction .
2.2 Transformer Network Approaches The Transformer network [ Vaswani et al . , 2017 ] has been used widely in neural machine translation
[ Tubay and Costa - juss ` a , 2018 , Edunov et al . , 2018 , Xia et al . , 2019 , Devlin et
al . , 2019 ] and has proven effective for sentiment analysis and emotion recognition .
However , existing architectures are very dense compared to our three lightweight models .
The Multimodal Transformer ( MuLT ) of Tsai et al .
[ 2019 ] modiÔ¨Åes the Transformer block to compute cross - modal attention for two modalities at a time .
It combines modalities in directed pairs , using a total of six Transformers , whose outputs are then merged into a single multimodal representation .
Unlike other works , MuLT is able to handle cases where the three modalities are not aligned at the word level ; it learns soft alignments via the cross - modal attention weights for each pair of modalities .
The model works well in the unaligned case , and in the aligned case , it gives state of the art performance the Happy emotion in IEMOCAP .
The Factorized Multimodal Transformer ( FMT)of Zadeh et
al .
[ 2019 ] introduces Factorized Multimodal Self - Attention ( FSM ) modules , which compute self - attention over unimodal , bimodal , and trimodal inputs in parallel .
FMT gives state of the art performance in the word - aligned case on CMU - MOSI and on the Sad , Angry , and Neutral emotions in IEMOCAP .
We use FMT , along with the word - aligned version of MuLT , as baselines for comparison in our experiments .
2.3 Canonical Correlation Approach The Interaction Canonical Correlation Network ( ICCN )
[ Sun et al . , 2020 ] implements Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis ( DCCA )
[ Andrew et al . , 2013 ] to extract bimodal features from the outer product matrix of a pair of modalities .
Sun et
al . use two pairs , text with audio and text with video ; these ‚Äú text - based audio ‚Äù and ‚Äú text - based video ‚Äù features are concatenated with purely textual features to form a multimodal embedding for sentiment analysis .
ICCN gives state - of - the - art performance on CMU - MOSEI and on the Sademotion in IEMOCAP .
3 Models 3.1 Input Alignment We useT , A , andV , to represent the three modalities : text , audio , and video , respectively .
Following the notation in [ Tsai et al . , 2019 ] and [ Zadeh et al . , 2019 ] , we denote the input as XT;A;V = fxT;xA;xVg where xi=
[ xt;i]fori2[T;A;V ] andt2[1 ;  ] and  is the length of the input sentence .
Each of the three modalities has its own lowlevel features , such as the Mel spectrogram for audio or facial landmarks for video .
These features are extracted at different sampling rates ‚Äî one set of features per word or character for text , per millisecond for audio , and per frame for video ‚Äî and thus the input sequences for the three modalities are often different .
A Ô¨Åve - thousand - millisecond audio sequence , for example , may be only a three - word sequence from a textual perspective and a 50 - frame sequence from a video perspective .
We align the audio and video to the text using the timestamps provided in the text transcripts .
The set of audio or video samples that correspond to a

Unimodal Transformers process each modality separately ; the outputs of these Transformers are summed and passed through a residual network of linear layers to produce the Ô¨Ånal prediction .
word in the transcript are combined using a series of 1D convolutional layers : XfT;A;V g = conv1D 
XfT;A;V g 2Rd wheredis a common feature dimension size .
This procedure ensures that the input sequence length is the same across modalities .
3.2 Transformer Blocks Our three lightweight architectures are comprised of Transformer blocks
[ Vaswani et al . , 2017 ] , which are non - recurrent neural networks that can process sequential data .
It consists of alternating attention and linear layers .
The attention block of a Transformer uses multi - head attention , where each head computes scaled dot product attention : attn(Q;K;V )
= softmaxQKT pdk V head i = attn QWQ i;KWK i;VWV i multi ( Q;K;V )
= [ head 1;:::;head h]WO whereQ , K , Vrepresent the query , key and value ; dkis the key dimension size ; WQ i , WK i , WV iare learned projection matrices for head i ; andWOis a learned projection matrix for the attention block .
In addition , Vaswani et al . note that positional encodings must be added to Transformer input because there is no sequential information present in the Transformer itself : PE ( pos;2i)=sin(pos=100002i = dmodel ) PE ( pos;2i+1)=cos(pos=100002i = dmodel ) ^X=X+PE3.3
Three Multimodal Architectures Figure 1 shows our Late Fusion architecture .
Three unimodal Transformers learn high - level features from the low - level input features of each modality .
The outputs of these unimodal Transformers are then merged together using a simple summation , rather than the merge layer used in previous work
[ Tsai et al . , 2019 ] , and passed to a residual network of linear layers
[ Xie et al . , 2017 ] for sentiment prediction .
Figure 2 shows our Round Robin architecture , which is a simpliÔ¨Åcation of MuTL
[ Tsai et al . , 2019 ] .
Three cross - modal Transformers learn bimodal feaatures for ordered pairs of modalities , where the query is one modality and the key / value is the other .
We use only three pairs ‚Äî text query and audio key / value , audio query and video key / value , and video query and text key / value ‚Äî with bimodal information Ô¨Çowing in only one direction ; in contrast , MuLT uses six pairs of crossmodal Transformers , with information Ô¨Çowing in both directions .
MuLT also uses three Transformers , one for each modality , to merge the two pairs sharing that modality as key / value ; our pairwise features are simply concatenated and passed to the output residual network .
Figure 3 shows our Hybrid Fusion architecture , which uses both an early fusion approach that concatenates the inputs and passes them to a single Transformer to learn trimodal features , as well as a late fusion approach that passes each modality through a separate Transformer to learn unimodal features .
The trimodal and unimodal features are concatenated together and merged using a layer of Gated Recurrent Units
[ Liang et al . , 2018 ] .
132 Figure 2 : Architecture of our Round Robin model .
Modalities are combined in a round - robin fashion via thrree cross - modal Transformers , one for each ordered pair of modalities :
[ T;A ] ;
[ A;V ] ; [ V;T ] .
The outputs of these cross - modal Transformers are concatenated and passed through a residual network of linear layers to produce the Ô¨Ånal prediction .
Figure 3 : Architecture of our Hybrid Fusion model .
All three modalities are passed through an early fusion Transformer to produce trimodal features ; in parallel , they are individually passed to separate Transformers to produce unimodal features .
All features are then concatenated and passed through a GRU and a residual network of linear layers to produce the Ô¨Ånal prediction .
4 Experiments We train our models on a single NVIDIA K80 GPU .
We tune hyperparameter values for our model using the validation sets provided by our evaluation datasets ; we achieve the best validation performance using 8 attention blocks per Transformer , each with 5 attention heads , and a hidden size was set to 40 .
The dropout rate was set to 0.15 ; the best learning rate for IEMOCAP was 0.02 , while for CMU - MOSI and CMU - MOSEI it was 0.01 , with batch sizes of 32 , 128 , and 40 , respectively .
4.1 Datasets IEMOCAP [ Busso et al . , 2008 ] consists of video recordings of 151 conversation sessions ( dialogues ) , totaling around 6k verbal interactions .
This dataset is intended for multilabel emotion classiÔ¨Åcation ; we evaluate on the four labeled emotions ( Happy , Sad , Angry , and Neutral ) used in previous work
[ Wang et al . , 2019 ] ; also following previouswork , we report binary accuracy and F1 score as the evaluation metrics on this dataset .
CMU - MOSI [ Zadeh et al . , 2016 ] is a sentiment analysis dataset of 2199 short monologues labeled in the range
[  3;3 ] , with 3being strongly negative and +3being strongly positive .
Following previous work , we report seven - class and binary accuracy , F1 score , mean absolute error , and correlation with human judgments .
CMU - MOSEI [ Zadeh et al . , 2018b ] is a sentiment and emotion analysis dataset of 23 K movie reviews from YouTube .
As with CMU - MOSI , it is labeled in the range of [  3;3 ] , and its evaluation metrics are the same as in CMU - MOSI .
4.2 Features and Alignment Text Features :
For word - level textual features we use the pretrained , 300 - dimensional , Common Crawl GloVe embeddings [ Pennington et al . , 2014 ] .
Audio Features : We use Neurospeech [ OrozcoArroyave et al . , 2018 ] to extract 74 low - level audio

[ Degottex et al . , 2014 ] to extract pitch tracking and voiced / unvoiced sloping parameters , peak slope parameters , and maximum dispersion quotients .
Video Features : We extract 35 facial units using Facet [ iMotions , 2017 ] , as well as 35 facial action units and 30 facial landmark and gaze fea - tures using OpenFace [ Baltrusaitis et al . , 2018 ] .
4.3 Baseline Models We compare our results with the state - of - the - art Multimodal Transformer ( MuLT)1[Tsai et al . , 2019 ] and Factorized Multimodal Transformer ( FMT )
[ Zadeh et al . , 2019 ] , as well as Memory Fusion Network ( MFN )
[ Zadeh et al . , 2018a ] , Recurrent Attended Variation Embedding Network ( RA VEN )
[ Wang et al . , 2019 ] , MultiAttention Recurrent Network ( MARN )
[ Zadeh et al . , 2018c ] , and Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network ( MCTN )
[ Pham et al . , 2019 ] .
These systems are described in Section 2 ; all attained state of the art on at least one of the evaluation datasets at their times of publication , and all use a similar feature set to our work .
5 Results and Discussion We present the results of our model compared to the reported results of our baseline models in Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 .
The best - performing MuLT and FMT models are extremely dense , with around 15 and 77 million parameters , respectively .
In contrast , our models have between 7 - 9 million trainable parameters , depending on the architecture ; despite using about half as many parameters as MuLT , we see that our models produce comparable results .
We perform fairly well on IEMOCAP , which has around 2717 training samples ; we achieve scores around 1 - 2 % below the best - performing model , FMT .
On the tiny CMU - MOSI dataset , which has just 1284 training samples , our Hybrid Fusion and 1We use the aligned version of MuLT for fair comparison with models that obligatorily use word alignments .

Late Fusion models give state of the art results on seven - way and binary accuracy , respectively .
The CMU - MOSEI dataset is much larger than IEMOCAP and CMU - MOSI , with close to 16265 training samples .
Our models perform the weakest on this dataset , falling short of the state of the art models by around 2 - 3 % , suggesting that our models may be too small to learn the entire distribution .
Neither MARN
[ Zadeh et al . , 2018c ] nor FMT [ Zadeh et al . , 2019 ] reports results on CMU - MOSEI , so they are omitted from Table 3 .
We also experiment with the open source code available for MuLT and FMT ( denoted by * ) .
Using the hyperparameter settings provided2 , we were nevertheless unable to match those systems ‚Äô reported performance , possibly due to differences 2Batch size for FMT * is not given ; we use 20 , the default.resulting from random initialization .
In training MuLT * and FMT * , we observe that the models are overÔ¨Åtting , with a mean difference of 15 - 20 % between the train and test accuracy ; in contrast , the largest train - test accuracy difference among our three models is only about 10 % .
The smaller number of parameters in our model reduces the risk of overÔ¨Åtting on smaller datasets , while still achieving good performance on larger datasets .
5.1 Analysis of Lightweight Architectures We compare the training time and memory footprint of our models with MuLT * and FMT * in Table 43 .
All models are trained on a single NVIDIA K80 GPU with 24 GB of memory .
We train for 30 epochs on IEMOCAP , 100 on CMU - MOSI and 40 3FMT * does not provide hyperparameter settings for CMUMOSEI , so those results are omitted .

on CMU - MOSEI ( the number of epochs needed for MuLT to converge , as reported by Tsai et al .
[ 2019 ] ) .
On the smallest dataset , CMU - MOSI , training MuLT * took just over seven minutes , while FMT * took 2.5 hours .
Our models train in under three minutes and outperform both MuLT * and FMT * , and this difference in training speed holds for CMUMOSI and CMU - MOSEI as well .
Thus our model , available in the supplementary materials4 , is the fastest and best - performing multimodal sentiment system currently available for public use .
We also conduct experiments on a substantially reduced IEMOCAP training subset of 1284 samples , matching the size of CMU - MOSI , which we create by randomly sampling from the full IEMOCAP training set .
Table 5 shows the results of our models , as well as MuLT * and FMT * , retrained on this smaller IEMOCAP training set , and evaluated on the full IEMOCAP test set .
We see that our models , with their smaller numbers of parameters , are better able to learn from limited training data than are state - of - the - art models with double or more the number of trainable parameters .
5.2 Analysis of Architecture Components We perform ablation experiments on our models using the IEMOCAP dataset ; ablation results for CMU - MOSI and CMU - MOSEI are omitted due to space constraints , but exhibit similar trends .
Table 6 presents the results of modality ablation on 4We will release it online after the anonymity period.the simplest Late Fusion model ; it clearly shows that unimodal and bimodal models are unable to match the performance of a full multimodal model .
This demonstrates the importance of considering all modalities when analyzing spoken language , since some of the emotions or sentiment may be dependent more on the audio or the visual actions of the speaker , rather than the text .
Examining the unimodal results , we see that the Text modality is the most informative for predictingHappy , Sad , and Neutral , while Audio is the most informative for Angry .
However , the bimodal results do not always match the unimodal results .
The best - performing bimodal model for Happy is [ V , A ] , despite Video being the worst - performing single modality , and [ T , A ] is the worst - performing bimodal model , despite both Text and Audio outperforming Video individually .
Considering the other three emotions , we see that the best bimodal model varies between [ T , A ] and [ V , A ] , with [ T , V ] generally performing the worst .
Table 7 shows the results of modality ablation on the Round Robin model ; as the architecture does not support unimodal experiments , only bimodal results are shown .
Comparing Table 6 to Table 7 , we see that the cross - modal Transformers of the fullRound Robin model are outperformed by the fullLate Fusion model .
However , the relative performance among modality pairs is consistent across Tables 6 and 7 .
Finally , Table 8 shows the results of modality ablation on the Hybrid Fusion model , where
we
136compare the relative contributions of the early fusion and late fusion halves of the architecture .
The top of the table shows the results of reducing the early fusion half to only two modalities while retaining all three modalities in the late fusion half , and the bottom shows the results of reducing the late fusion half to two modalities while retaining all three in the early fusion half ; in both sets of experiments , the overall model has access to all three modalities , but only through either the early fusion path or the late fusion path .
Surprisingly , although standalone early fusion models are outperformed by standalone late fusion models [ Tsai et al . , 2019 ] , we Ô¨Ånd that a hybrid model containing a full , trimodal early fusion half is more robust to modality ablation in its late fusion half than a model with a full late fusion half is to an ablated early fusion half .
Our results in this experiment also show greater variability among modality pairs .
The [ T , A ] combination , which gave the best performance in the Late Fusion andRound Robin experiments , remains the strongest modality pair for the full early fusion , bimodal late fusion model .
In contrast , for the bimodal early fusion , full late fusion model , [ T , A ] is outperformed by one of the two Video - based modality pairs , [ T , V ] or [ V , A ] , on each of the four emotions , suggesting that the performance gap of early versus late fusion differs across modalities .
5.2.1 Order of Modalities in Round Robin
The effect of direction on our Round Robin model is shown in Table 9 ; this experiment shows the impact of the direction of information Ô¨Çow across modalities within the model .
Comparing our results to those of MuLT and MuLT * , we see that capturing information Ô¨Çow in one direction , text to audio to video and back to text , is enough for a model to give good predictions , without requiring the additional overhead of handling both directions .
We can also see that the direction does matter ; the performance of the Round Robin model with information Ô¨Çowing in the opposite direction , from video to audio to text and back to video , is relatively poor .
These results suggest that the interactions between pairs of modalities are directed .
6 Conclusion We have presented three lightweight architectures for multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition .
The Late Fusion model merges unimodal features , the Round Robin model iterativelycombines bimodal features , and the Hybrid EarlyLate Fusion model combines early - fusion trimodal and late - fusion unimodal features .
Our proposed models are much smaller in size compared to existing state - of - the - art models ; they are able to attain new state - of - the - art scores on the CMU - MOSI and CMU - MOSEI datasets on two metrics , while remaining competitive on the others .
Further , our experiments analyzing the relative contribution of modalities and architecture components in our models suggest new directions for developing multimodal systems .
We hope that our simple architectures for sentiment and emotion detection , currently the fastest and best - performing publicly available system , as well as the insights revealed in our experimental results , can be useful for further research in the Ô¨Åeld .
