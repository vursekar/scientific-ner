Most recently , neural approaches have been proposed to improve over SOTA models from earlier paradigms .
So far none of the published neural models leverage external semantic knowledge such as type information .
This paper offers the ﬁrst such model and evaluation , demonstrating modest gains in accuracy by introducing either gold standard or predicted types .
In the proposed approach , type information serves both to ( 1 ) improve mention representation and ( 2 ) create a soft type consistency check between coreference candidate mentions .
Our evaluation covers two different grain sizes of types over four different benchmark corpora .
1 Introduction Coreference resolution ( CR ) is an extensively studied problem in computational linguistics and NLP ( Hobbs , 1978 ;
Lappin and Leass , 1994 ; Mitkov , 1999 ; Ng , 2017 ; Clark and Manning , 2016 ; Lee et al . , 2017 ) .
Solutions to this problem allow us to make meaningful links between concepts and entities within a discourse and therefore serves as a valuable pre - processing step for downstream tasks like summarization and questionanswering ( Steinberger et al . , 2007 ;
Dasigi et al . , 2019 ; Sukthanker et al . , 2020a ) .
Recently , multiple datasets including Ontonotes ( Pradhan et al . , 2012 ) , Litbank ( Bamman et al . , 2020 ) , EmailCoref ( Dakle et al . , 2020 ) , and WikiCoref ( Ghaddar and Langlais , 2016 ) have been proposed as benchmark datasets for CR , especially in the sub - area of entity anaphora ( Sukthanker et al . , 2020b ) .
Entity anaphora is a simpler starting place for work on anaphora because unlike abstract anaphora ( Webber , 1991 ) , entity anaphora are pronouns or noun phrases that refer to an explicitly mentioned entity in thediscourse rather than an abstract idea that must be constructed from a repackaging of information revealed over an extended text .
An affordance of entity anaphora is that they have easily articulated semantic types .
Most of the entity CR datasets are extensively annotated for syntactic features ( like constituency parse etc . ) and semantic features ( like entity - types ) .
However , none of the published SOTA methods ( Lee et al . , 2017 ; Joshi et al . , 2019 , 2020 ) explicitly leverage the type information .
In this paper , we present a proof of concept to portray the beneﬁts of using type information in neural approaches for CR .
Named entities are generally divided generically ( e.g. person , organization etc . ) or in a domain - speciﬁc manner ( e.g. symptom , drug , test etc . ) .
In this work , we consider CR datasets that contain generic entitytypes .
One challenge is that the different corpora do not utilize the same set of type tags .
For example , OntoNotes includes 18 types while EmailCoref includes only 4 .
Thus , we evaluate the performance of the proposed modeling approach on each dataset both with the set of type tags germaine to the dataset as well as a common set of four basic types ( person , org , location , facility ) inspired from research on Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) ( Tjong Kim Sang , 2002 ; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder , 2003 ) .
Our motivation is similar to ( Durrett and Klein , 2014 ) , which used a structured CRF with handcurated features to jointly - model the tasks of CR , entity typing , and entity linking .
Their joint architecture showed an improved performance on CR over the independent baseline .
However , our work differs from there ’s as we show the beneﬁts of entity - type information in neural models that use contextualized representations like BERT ( Peters et al . , 2018 ) .
Some prior art ( Petroni et al . , 2019 ; Roberts et al . , 2020 ) argues that contextual-

( 1 ) Type information is concatenated with the mention span representation created by their model ; and ( 2 ) A consistency check is incorporated that compares the types of two mentions under consideration to calculate the coreference score .

ized embeddings implicitly capture facts and relationships between real - world entities .
However , in this work , we empirically show that access to explicit knowledge about entity - types beneﬁts neural models that use BERT for CR .
We show a consistent improvement in performance on four different coreference datasets from varied domains .
Our contribution is that we evaluate the impact of the introduction of type information in neural entity coreference at two different levels of granularity ( which we refer to as original vs common ) , demonstrating their utility both in the case where gold standard type information is available , and the more typical case where it is predicted .
2 Related Work Neural Coreference Resolution :
Recently , neural approaches to coreference ( Joshi et al . , 2020 , 2019 ; Lee et al . , 2018 , 2017 ) have begun to show their prowess .
The SOTA models show impressive performance on state - of - the - art datasets like OntoNotes ( Pradhan et al . , 2012 ) and GAP ( Webster et al . , 2018 ) .
The notable architecture proposed by Lee et al .
( 2017 ) scores pairs of entity mentions independently and later uses a clustering algorithm to ﬁnd coreference clusters .
On the other hand , Lee et al .
( 2018 ) improve upon this foundation by introducing an approximated higher - order inference that iteratively updates theexisting span representation using its antecedent distribution .
Moreover , they propose a coarseto-ﬁne grained approach to pairwise scoring for tackling the computational challenges caused due to the iterative higher - order inference .
More recently , Joshi et al .
( 2019 , 2020 ) showed that use of contextual representations instead of wordembeddings like GloVe ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) can further boost the results over and above those just mentioned .
Our work offers additional improvement by building on the model proposed in Bamman et
al . ( 2020 ) , which is based on Lee et al . ( 2017 ) , and adds additional nuanced information grounded in semantic types .
Type Information : Named Entity Recognition datasets ( Tjong Kim Sang , 2002 ; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder , 2003 ;
Li et al . , 2016 ) often group entity mentions into different types ( or categories ) depending on the domain and the potential downstream applications of the corpus .
For example , the medical corpus used in the i2b2 Challenge 2010 ( Uzuner et al . , 2011 ) annotates domain - speciﬁc types like problem , test , symptometc . , whereas , a more general - domain dataset like CoNLL-2002 ( Tjong Kim Sang , 2002 ) uses generic types like person , organization , and location .
Type information as a predictive signal has been shown to be beneﬁcial for NLP tasks like relation extraction ( Soares et al . , 2019 ) and entitylinking ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) .
It affords some level
22of disambiguation , which assists models with ﬁltering out some incorrect predictions in order to increase the probability of a correct prediction .
In this work , we evaluate the beneﬁts of using explicit type information for CR .
We show that a model that leverages entity types associated with the anaphoric/ antecedent mentions signiﬁcantly reduces the problem of type inconsistency in the output coreference clusters and thus improves the overall performance of the neural baseline on four datasets .
Type Information for CR : Multiple prior works have shown type - information to be a useful feature for shallow coreference resolution classiﬁers ( Soon et al . , 2001 ; Bengtson and Roth , 2008 ; Ponzetto and Strube , 2006 ; Haghighi and Klein , 2010 ; Durrett and Klein , 2014 ) .
( Soon et al . , 2001 ) take the most frequent sense for each noun in WordNet as the semantic class for that noun and use a decision - tree for pairwise classiﬁcation of whether two samples co - refer each other .
( Bengtson and Roth , 2008 ) use a hypernym tree to extract the type information for different common nouns , and compare the proper names against a predeﬁned list to determine if the mention is a person .
They , then , pass this and many other features ( like distance , agreement , etc . ) through a regularized average perceptron for pairwise classiﬁcation .
This paper expands on these studies to show that entity - type information is also beneﬁcial for neural models that use contextualized representations like BERT ( Peters et al . , 2018 ) , which have been argued to implicitly capture facts and relationships between real - world entities ( Petroni et al . , 2019 ; Roberts et al . , 2020 ) .
3 Model In this section , we explain how we introduce type information into a neural CR system .
3.1 Baseline We use the model proposed in Bamman et al . ( 2020 ) as our baseline .
The model gives stateof - the - art scores on the LitBank corpus ( Bamman et al . , 2020 ) and is an end - to - end mention ranking system based on Lee et al .
( 2017 ) , which has shown competitive performance on the OntoNotes dataset .
However , this model differs from Lee et al . ( 2017 ) as it uses BERT embeddings , omits author and genre information , and only focuses on the task of mention - linking .
Since our maingoal is to evaluate the beneﬁts of type information , we too separate mention - linking from mentionidentiﬁcation and only show results computed over gold - standard mentions .
This controls for the effects of the mention - identiﬁcation module ’s performance on our experiments .
Impact of typeinformation incorporation in the real - world endto - end CR setting ( mention identiﬁcation + linking ) is left as future work .
The BERT embeddings for each token iare passed through a bi - directional LSTM ( xi ) .
To represent a mention mwith start and end positions s ; erespectively , xs , xe , attention over xs ; : : : ; x e , and features to represent the width ( wi ) and inclusion within quotations ( qu ) are concatenated .
m=
[ xs;xe;Att(xs ; : : ; x e);wi;qu ] ( 1 ) Finally , given the representation of two mentions mjandmk , their coreference score S(mj ; mk)is computed by concatenating mj , mk , mj  mk , distance ( d ) between the mentions and whether one mention is nested ( n ) within the other , which are then passed through fully - connected layers ( FC ) .
S(mj ; mk ) = FC([mj;mk;mj  mk;d;n])(2 )
We refer the reader to ( Bamman et al . , 2020 ; Lee et al . , 2017 ) for more details about the architecture .
3.2 Entity Type Information We improve the above model by including entitytype information on two levels ( Figure 1 ) .
First , we concatenate the entity - type tof the mention to m(in Eq . 1 ) to improve the mention representation .
m0=
[ m;t ] ( 3 ) This allows the model access to the entity type of the mention as an additional feature .
We call this + ET - self .
Second , to check the type consistency ( softly ) between any two mentions under consideration as possibly coreferent , we append a feature ( tc ) in Eq . 2 , which takes the value 0 if both mentions have the same type , and 1 otherwise .
For example , in Figure 1 , since Los Angeles andithave the same entity - type PLACE , tcjk= 0 .
S0(m0 j ; m0 k )
= FC([m0 j;m0 k;m0 j  m0 k;d;n;tcjk ] ) ( 4 ) This part of the approach is referred to as + ETcross throughout the remainder of the paper .
We
23decide against the use of a hard consistency check ( which would ﬁlter out mentions which do not have the same type ) as it might not generalize well to bridging anaphora ( Clark , 1975 ) where the anaphor refers to an object that is associated with , but not identical to , the antecedent ( Poesio et al . , 2018 ) .
In such cases , the type of the anaphora and its antecedent may not match .
Finally , our architecture combines both components together as + ET ( ET = ET - self + ET - cross ) .
4 Datasets We gauge the beneﬁts of using entity - type information on the four datasets discussed below .
LitBank .
This dataset ( Bamman et al . , 2020 ) contains coreference annotations for 100 literary texts.1This dataset limits the markable mentions to six entity - types , where majority of the mentions ( 83:1 % ) point to a person .
EmailCoref .
This dataset ( Dakle et al . , 2020 ) comprises of 46 email threads with a total of 245 email messages.2Similar to LitBank , it considers a mention to be a span of text that refers to a real - world entity .
In this work , we ﬁlter out pronouns that point towards multiple entities in the email ( e.g. we , they ) thus only focusing on singular mentions .
Ontonotes .
From this multi - lingual dataset , we evaluate on the subset ( english ) from OntoNotes that was used in the CoNLL-2012 shared task ( Pradhan et al . , 2012).3It contains 2802 training , 343 development , and 348 test documents .
The dataset differs from LitBank in its annotation scheme with the biggest difference being the fact that it does not annotate singletons .
It contains annotations for 18 different entitytypes .
However , unlike LitBank and EmailCoref , not all mentions have an associated entity - type .
For example , none of the pronoun mentions are given a type even if they act as anaphors to typed entities .
We partially ameliorate this issue by extracting gold coreference clusters that contain at least one typed mention and assigning the majority type in that cluster to all of its elements .
For example , in Figure 1 , if Los Angeles is typed PLACE , anditis in the gold coreference cluster of Los Angeles ( no other element in the cluster ) , then itis also assigned the type PLACE .

WikiCoref .
This corpus , released by ( Ghaddar and Langlais , 2016 ) , comprises 30 documents from wikipedia annotated for coreference resolution.4The annotations contain additional metadata , like the associated freebase rdf link for each mention ( if available ) .
We use this rdf entry to extract the mention ’s entity types from freebase dump .
Mentions that do not get any type are marked NA .
The ﬁrst 24 documents are chosen for training , the next 3 for development , and the rest for testing .
The above - discussed datasets differ in the number as well as the categories of entity - types they originally annotate ( Table 1 ) .
Apart from a common list of types ( like PER , ORG , LOC ) , they also include corpus - speciﬁc categories like DIGital ( EmailCoref ) , MONey , and LANG ( OntoNotes ) .
We carry out experiments with two sets of types – original and common – for each dataset .
The common set of types include the following 5 categories : PER , ORG , LOC , FAC , OTHER .
5 Experiments and Results In this section , we provide the results of our empirical experiments .
Evaluation Metrics : We convert all three datasets into the CoNLL 2012 format and report the F1 score for MUC , B3 , and CEAF metrics using the CoNLL-2012 ofﬁcial scripts .
The performances are compared on the average F1 of the abovementioned metrics .
For EmailCoref , OntoNotes , and WikiCoref , we report the mean score of 5 independent runs of the model with different seeds .
Whereas , for LitBank , we present the 10 - fold cross - validation results.5 4http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/?q=en/wikicoref 5Hyperparameter values are provided in Appendix A.

5.1 Performance with Original Types In order to establish an upper bound for improvement through introduction of type information , our ﬁrst experiment leverages the original list of entity - types annotated in different corpora ( + ET ( orig ) ) , using the gold standard labels for types .
Inclusion of entity - type information improves over the baseline for all CR datasets .
Table 2 presents the performance of the baseline model and the model with entity - type information .
We ﬁnd that entity - type information gives a boost of 0.96 Avg . F1 ( p < 0:01 ) on LitBank which is the new state - of - the - art score with goldmentions .
This suggests that type information is helpful for CR on LitBank despite the heavily skewed distribution of entity - types in this corpus .
Similarly , type information also beneﬁts EmailCoref and WikiCoref resulting in an absolute improvement of 1.67 and 2.9 Avg . F1 points respectively ( p < 0:01 ) .
We also see a 2.4 Avg . F1 improvement ( p < 0:01 ) on OntoNotes , the largest dataset in this study .
This suggests that explicit access to type information is beneﬁcial all over the board , despite the use of contextual representations which have been claimed to model realworld facts and relationships ( Petroni et al . , 2019 ) .
Ablation Results : To understand the contribution of the inclusion of type information to improve mention representation ( + ET - self ) and type consistency check between candidate mentions ( + ET - Dataset Baseline + ET - self + ET - cross + ET ( orig ) LitBank 79.30 79.97 79.76 80.26 EmailCoref 73.33 73.98 74.32 76.17

cross ) , we perform an ablation study ( Table 3 ) .
We ﬁnd that both components consistently provide signiﬁcant performance boosts over the baseline .
However , their combination ( + ET ) performs the best across all datasets .
5.2 Performance with Common Types The previous experiment leverages the original entity - types assigned by dataset annotators .
Due to the differences in domain and annotation guidelines among these datasets , the annotators introduce several domain - speciﬁc entity types ( e.g. DIGital , Work Of Art etc . )
apart from the common four ( PERson , ORGanization , LOCation , FACility ) that are often used in the Named Entity Recognition literature ( Tjong Kim Sang , 2002 ) .
The former can prove to be much more difﬁcult to obtain/ learn due to dearth of relevant data .
Therefore , to assess the worth of using a common entitytype list for all datasets , we map the original types ( Table 1 ) to the above - mentioned four common types.6Categories that do not map to any common type are assigned Other .+ET
( com ) rows in Table 2 show the results for this experiment .
Models trained with common types as features perform worse than + ET ( orig ) which was expected as several original types are now clubbed into a single category ( e.g. LAW - > OTHER , LANG - > OTHER ) thus somewhat reducing the effectiveness of the feature .
One surprising observation is the small difference between the performance on OntoNotes dataset , despite the fact that the number of type categories reduce from 18 + Other ( + ET ( orig ) ) to 4 + Other ( + ET ( com ) ) .
This could either be because ( 1 ) the entities with corpus - speciﬁc types occur less frequently in Ontonotes , or ( 2 ) the baseline model does a good job in resolving them .
Further research is required to understand this case which is out of scope for this work .
6We provide the mapping between the original types and the common types in Appendix B.
25 Figure 2 : Type - prediction model .
5.3 # Impure Clusters ( # IC ) Our hypothesis around the use of entity - types was to provide additional information to the model that could be leveraged to minimize errors due to type mismatch in CR .
To evaluate if the F1 score improvements achieved by + ET models are because of fewer type mismatch errors , we report the number of coreference clusters detected by the model that contain at least one element with a type that is different from the others in the cluster .
Since all of the datasets used in this work only consider identity coreferences ( Recasens et al . , 2011 ) - with potentially varied deﬁnitions of identity ( Bamman et al . , 2020 ; Pradhan et al . , 2012 ) - where the mention is a linguistic " re - packaging " of its antecedent , this measure makes sense .
As shown in Table 2 , the models that score lower on the impurity measure get a higher Avg F1 .
This suggests that the aggregate performance improvements are at least partly due to the better mention - mention comparison in + ET systems .
6 Predicted Types Results shown in the previous section assume the presence of gold standard types during training as well as inference , which is often impractical in the real - world .
Most of the new samples that a CR model would encounter would not include type information about the candidate mentions .
Therefore , we set up an additional experiment to gauge the beneﬁts of type information using predicted types .
We introduce a baseline approach to infer the type of the mentions and then use these predictions in the + ET models , in place of the gold types , for coreference resolution .
6.1 Type Prediction Model Given the mention and its immediate context , i.e. the sentence it occurs in ( S = : : : ; c 2 ; c 1;e1;e2 ; : : : ; en ; c1 ; c2 ; : : :) , we add markers < ENT_START > /<ENT_END
> before/ after the beginning/ ending of the mention in the sentence .
The new sequence ( S0= : : : ; c 2 ; c 1;<ENT_START > , e1;e2 ; : : : ; en ; < ENT_END > , c1 ; c2 ; : : :) is tokenized using BERT tokenizer and passed through the BERT encoder .
The output from which is then mean - pooled and passed through a fully - connected layer for classiﬁcation .
This architecture is motivated from ( Soares et al . , 2019 ) who show that adding markers around entities before passing the sentence through BERT performs better for relation extraction .
6.2 Experiments and Results Type Prediction : Our ﬁnal evaluation of the use of types in coreference is perhaps the most important one as it uses predicted types rather than annotated types , thus demonstrating that the beneﬁts can be achieved in practice .
Here we use the Type Prediction Model described just above .
We limit the length of the input sequence to 128 tokens and use BERT - base - cased model for our type - prediction experiments .
We perform a ﬁvefold cross - validation to predict the type for each mention in the dataset .
Since all four datasets suffer from class - imbalance , we report both Macro F1 score as well as the accuracy for the model .
The model is trained for 20 epochs , with earlystopping ( patience = 10 ) , and is ﬁne - tuned on the development set for Macro F1 to give more importance to minority type categories .
We do not consider NA as a separate class during type prediction for WikiCoref and OntoNotes .
For evaluation of our type - prediction model , we ignore the mentions that do not have an associated gold type ( NA ) from the ﬁnal numbers in Table 4 .
As shown , our model performs well on LitBank , EmailCoref , and Ontonotes due to their favorable size in terms of training samples for the BERT - based type predictor .
WikiCoref , however , proves more challenging as the model only manages 38:0Macro F1 points with original ( orig ) types and 45:0with common types ( com ) , portraying its lack of ability to learn minority type categories with less data .
Furthermore , our model ﬁnds it easier to predict the common ( com ) set of types for each dataset as combining multiple corpus - speciﬁc types into one partially alleviates the problem of class - imbalance .
In line with our expectation , the largest improvement due to common types is seen for OntoNotes where the prob-

Coreference Resolution : Each mention in the corpus occurs in the test - sets of the ﬁve - fold cross - validation type - prediction experiments exactly once .
This allows us to infer the type of each mention using the model that is trained on a different subset of the dataset .
These inferred types are used in the training and testing of the CR systems in a manner similar to the annotated types .
Empirically , we found that the above conﬁguration performs better than using the + ET models trained with annotated types and testing with predicted types , as the former exposes the CR models to the noisy types during training thus allowing them to learn weights that take this noise into account .
We report the results for both original ( + ET - pred ( orig ) ) and common ( + ET - pred ( com ) ) type categories on each dataset .
Table 5 shows the results for performance of the baseline and the type - informed models on the four datasets , where the types are inferred from the model described in Section 6.1 .
We ﬁnd that the improvements from type - information persist across LitBank , EmailCoref , and OntoNotes despite the use of predicted types , but , quite expectedly , remain smaller than the improvements from the gold annotated types .
Scores on WikiCorefshow no signiﬁcant improvement over the baseline , which could be explained by the poor performance of the type prediction model on this dataset which reduces the potency of the feature for CR .
7 Discussion 7.1 Genres of OntoNotes Table 6 shows the most frequently occurring entity - types for each of the genres in OntoNotes .
In line with our intuition , we ﬁnd that enity - type information helps the baseline in bc , bn , wb , and mzgenres which have less skew in their entity - type distribution .
Genres like bc , bnandwb , although dominated by PER entities , contain a substantial minority of other entity - types like ORG and GPE .
Along the same lines , mzcontains a majority of GPE entities but also enough entities with type PER and ORG to make type information a potentially useful feature for CR .
However , two exceptions to this are the improved performance of + ET ( orig ) ontc(highest skew ) and no signiﬁcant improvement on nw(lowest skew ) .
These ﬁndings prompt further research in the future .
7.2 Type Prediction : PRP vs NP Entity coreference in discourse often takes the surface form of pronouns ( PRP ) ( like she , they , that , it etc . ) or noun phrases ( NP ) ( like LA , John ’s brother etc . )
In Table 4 , we compare the performance of our type prediction model on different types of pronouns , and noun phrases of varying length .
We ﬁnd that the model does well in predicting types for personal pronouns ( PRP ( pers . ) )
likeshe , heand noun phrases ( NP ) .

Numbers in round brackets denote the cluster number of the mention .
Red denotes incorrect predictions .
nouns ( PRP ( dem . ) )
like this , that , and itacross all datasets .
This reduced performance could be due to the fact that demonstrative pronouns do not contain any signal about the type of the entity they refer to .
Therefore , the type prediction model has to solely rely on the context to make that decision .
However , this is not the case with PRPs ( pers . )
and NPs where the mention string is usually a strong indicator of the type .
This problem is worsened by the imbalance due to the small presence of
PRP ( dem . ) mentions in difference CR datasets .
Since , the model does not encounter enough PRPs ( dem . ) , it might not be able to learn to give high importance to context in these cases .
This could be partially alleviated by creatinga separate type - prediction path for PRP ( dem . ) where the mention span is masked before it is passed through the model .
A model that is trained with masked mentions would focus more on the context for type prediction and thus could lead to better performance on PRPs ( dem . ) .
One could also experiment with training the type - prediction model on all of the mentions across the four datasets .
The common list of types introduced in this work would allow for the creation of a larger training - set that includes mentions from multiple corpora ( including external NER datasets ) which could provide enough signal for the model to better learn the common types for PRPs ( dem . ) .
Both these approaches could further boost the
28results for CR with predicted entity - types , ultimately , reducing the gap between the scores in Table 2 and 5 .
However , they are left as future work as they are out of scope for this paper .
7.3 Case Study Table 7 provides an excerpt of an email from EmailCoref corpus .
As shown , the baseline model predicts the coreference clusters for an organizer ( DIG ) and PricewaterhouseCoopers Calgary ( ORG ) incorrectly .
For the former , the model mistakes it as a reference to your current home address ( LOC ) which is corrected by the entity - type aware models .
For the latter , the baseline considers PricewaterhouseCoopers Calgary ( PCC ) as part of a new coreference cluster , even though it refers to the organization of the email ’s sender which was previously referred to as wein the email .
Models with access to gold type information ( + ET ( orig ) and + ET ( com ) ) are able to make that connection .
+ ET - pred ( orig ) , however , is unable to cluster PCC correctly which could be due to the fact that the type - prediction model incorrectly classiﬁes the type of weas PER rather than ORG .
This could lead to the CR model considering PCC ( ORG ) as a new entity in the discourse rather than a postcedent ofwe .
This example demonstrates that sentencelevel context might not be sufﬁcient in some cases for mention type - disambiguation .
We intend to experiment with models that capture long - term context and leverage external knowledge in the future .
8 Conclusion In this work , we show the importance of using entity - type information in neural coreference resolution ( CR ) models with contextualized embeddings like BERT .
Models which leverage type information , annotated in the corpus , substantially outperform the baseline on four CR datasets by reducing the number of type mismatches in detected coreference clusters .
Since , these datasets vary in number and categories of the types they deﬁne , we also experiment with mapping the original corpus types to four common types ( PER , ORG , LOC , FAC ) based on previous NER research that can be learnt more easily through large NER datasets .
Models which use these common types perform slightly worse than original types but still show signiﬁcant improvements over the baseline systems .
The presence of gold standard types during CR inference is unlikely in practice .
Therefore , we propose a model that infers the type of a mention given the mention span and its immediate context to use along side the proposed CR approach .
In our evaluation , we ﬁnd that using types predicted by our model for CR still performs signiﬁcantly better than the baseline , thus offering stronger evidence that type information holds the potential for practical improvements for CR .

These types are annotated in most of the named - entity recognition datasets and therefore are easier to model and learn via machine learning approaches .
Tables A2 , A3 , A4 , A5 show the mapping between the original types of each coreference dataset used in our study to the reduced common types .
The most drastic difference occurs for OntoNotes ( 19 - > 5 ) and WikiCoref ( 8 - > 5 ) .
OTHER type in WikiCoref is for freebase links that did not have an associated type stored in freebase , whereas NAis used for mentions which do not have a freebase link .
For OntoNotes , NArefers to the mentions that did not get any type assigned to them even after the use of our cluster based type - propagation approach ( explained in Section 4 ) .
