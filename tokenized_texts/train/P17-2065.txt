Abstract Compositor attribution , the clustering of pages in a historical printed document by the individual who set the type , is a bibliographic task that relies on analysis of orthographic variation and inspection of visual details of the printed page .
In this paper , we introduce a novel unsupervised model that jointly describes the textual and visual features needed to distinguish compositors .
Applied to images of Shakespeare ’s First Folio , our model predicts attributions that agree with the manual judgements of bibliographers with an accuracy of 87 % , even on text that is the output of OCR .
1 Introduction Within literary studies , the ﬁeld of bibliography has an unusually long tradition of quantitative analysis .
One particularly relevant area is that ofcompositor attribution — the clustering of pages in a historical printed document by the individual ( the compositor ) who set the type .
Like stylometry , a long - standing area of NLP that has largely focused on attributing the authorship of text ( Holmes , 1994 ; Hope , 1994 ; Juola , 2006 ; Koppel et al . , 2009 ; Jockers and Witten , 2010 ) , the analysis of orthographic patterns is fundamental to compositor attribution .
Additionally , compositor attribution often makes use of visual features , such as whitespace layout , introducing new challenges .
These analyses have traditionally been done by hand , but efforts are painstaking due to the difﬁculty of manually recording these features .
In this paper , we present an unsupervised model speciﬁcally designed for compositor attribution that incorporates both textual and visual sources of evidence traditionally used by bibliographers ( Hinman , 1963 ; Taylor , 1981 ; Blayney , 1991 ) .
spellingvariation spacing variationmedial commaFigure 1 : The compositor of the left page tended to use the spellings doe anddeere , while the compositor for the right page used spellings doanddeare , indicating these pages were likely set by different people .
The varying width of the medial comma whitespace also distinguishes the typesetters .
Our model jointly describes the patterns of variation both in orthography and in the whitespace between glyphs , allowing us to cluster pages by discovering patterns of similarity and difference .
When applied to digital scans of historical printed documents , our approach learns orthographic and whitespace preferences of individual compositors and predicts groupings of pages set by the same compositor.1This is , to our knowledge , the ﬁrst attempt to perform compositor attribution automatically .
Prior work has proposed automatic approaches to authorship attribution — which is typically viewed as the supervised problem of identifying a particular author given samples of their writing .
In contrast , compositor attribution lacks supervision because compositors are unknown and , in addition , focuses on different linguistic patterns .
We explain spellings of words conditioned on word choice , not the word choice itself .
1The validity of compositor attribution has sparked an ongoing and heated debate among bibliographers ( McKenzie , 1969 , 1984 ; Rizvi , 2016 ) ; while some reject parts or all of this approach , it continues to be cited in authoritative bibliographical texts ( Gaskell , 2007 ; Blayney , 1996 ) .
Without taking a position in this debate , we seek only to automate the methods that remain in use by particular bibliographers ( Blayney , 1996 ; Burrows , 2013).411

Then , each diplomatic word , dij , is generated conditioned on ciand the corresponding modern word , mij , from a distribution parameterized by weight vector wc .
Finally , each medial comma spacing width ( measured in pixels ) , sik , is generated conditioned oncifrom a distribution parameterized byθc .
To evaluate our approach , we ﬁt our model to digital scans of Shakespeare ’s
First Folio ( 1623 ) — a document with well established manual judgements of compositor attribution .
We ﬁnd that even when relying on noisy OCR transcriptions of textual content , our model predicts compositor attributions that agree with manual annotations 87 % of the time , outperforming several simpler baselines .
Our approach opens new possibilities for considering patterns across a larger vocabulary of words and at a higher visual resolution than has been possible historically .
Such a tool may enable scalable ﬁrst - pass analysis in understudied domains as a complement to humanistic studies of composition .
2 Background In this paper we focus on modeling the same types of observations made by scholars and demonstrate agreement with authoritative attributions .
We use compositor studies of Shakespeare ’s First Folio to inform our approach , drawing on the methods proposed by Hinman ( 1963 ) , Howard - Hill ( 1973 ) , and Taylor ( 1981 ) .
Hinman ’s landmark 1963 study clustered the pages of the First Folioaccording to ﬁve different compositors based on variations in spelling among three common words .
Figure 1 , for example , shows portions of two pages of the First Folio with different spelling variants for the words dear anddo : one compositor used deere anddoe , while the other used deare anddo .
Hinman relied on the assumption that each compositor was consistent in their preferences for the sake of convenience in the typesetting process ( Blayney , 1991 ) .
Subsequent studies looked at larger sets of words and more general orthographic preferences ( e.g. the preference to terminate words with -ie instead of -y ) , leading to modiﬁcations of Hinman ’s original analysis(Howard - Hill , 1973 ; Taylor , 1981 ) .
In this paper we propose a probabilistic model designed to capture both word - speciﬁc preferences and general orthographic patterns .
To separate the effect of the compositor from the choices made by the author or editor , we condition on a modernized ( collated ) version of Shakespeare ’s text as was done by scholars .
Visual features , including typeface usage and whitespace layout , also inform compositor attribution .
For example , the highlighted spacing in Figure 1 shows different choices after medial commas ( commas that occur before the end of the line ) .
Bibliographers produced new hypotheses about how many compositors were involved in production based on the analysis of the use of spaces before and after punctuation ( Howard - Hill , 1973 ; Taylor , 1981 ) .
We additionally incorporate this source of evidence into to our automatic approach by modeling pixel - level whitespace distances .
Bibliographers also use contextual information to inform their analyses , including copy text orthography , printing house records , collation , type case usage , and the use of type with cast - on spaces .
In our model , we restrict our analysis to only those features that can be derived from the OCR output and simple visual analysis .
3 Model Our computational approach to compositor attribution operates on the sources of evidence that have been considered by bibliographers .
In particular , we focus on jointly modeling patterns of orthographic variation and spacing preferences across pages of a document , treating compositor assignments as latent variables in a generative model .
We assume access to a diplomatic transcription of the document ( a transcription faith-412
ful to the original orthography ) , which we automatically align with a modernized version.2We experiment with both manually and automatically ( OCR ) produced transcriptions , and assume access to pixel - level spacing information on each page , which can be extracted using OCR as described in Section 4 .
Figure 2 shows the generative process .
In our model , each of Itotal pages is generated independently .
The compositor assignment for theith page is represented by the variable ci∈ { 1 , . . .
, C}and is generated from a multinomial prior .
For page i , each diplomatic word , dij , is generated conditioned on the corresponding modern word , mij , and the compositor who set the page , ci .
Finally , the model produces the pixel width of the space after each medial comma , sik , again conditioned on the compositor , ci .
The joint distribution for page i , conditioned on modern text , takes the following form : P({dij},{sik } , ci|{mij } ) = P(ci )
[ Prior on compositors ] · Ji / productdisplay j=1P(dij|mij , ci;wci)[Orthographic model ] · Ki / productdisplay k=1P(sik|ci;θci )
[ Whitespace model ] 3.1 Orthographic Preference Model
We choose the parameterization of the distribution of diplomatic words in order to capture two types of spelling preference : ( 1 ) general preferences for certain character groups ( such as -ie ) and ( 2 ) preferences that only pertain to a particular word and do not indicate a larger pattern .
Since it is unknown which of the two behaviors is dominant , we let the model describe both and learn to separate their effects .
Using a log - linear parameterization , P(d|m , c;w)∝exp(w / latticetop cf(m , d ) ) we introduce features to capture both effects .
Here , f(m , d)is a feature function deﬁned on modern word mpaired with diplomatic word d , whilewcis a weight vector corresponding to compositor c. 2Modern editions are common for many books that are of interest to bibliographers , though future work could consider how to cope with their absence .
To capture word - speciﬁc preferences we add an indicator feature for each pair of modern word m and diplomatic spelling d.
We refer to these as WORD features below .
To capture general orthographic preferences we introduce an additional set of features based on the edit operations involved in the computation of Levenshtein distance between mandd .
In particular , each operation is added as a separate feature , both with and without local context ( previous or next character of the modern word ) .
We refer to this group as EDIT features .
The weight vector for each compositor represents their unique biases , as shown in the depiction of these parameters in Figure 2 . 3.2 Whitespace Preference Model Manual analysis of spacing has revealed differences across pages .
In particular , the choice of spaced or non - spaced punctuation marks is hypothesized by biobliographers to be indicative of compositor preference and speciﬁc typecase .
We add whitespace distance to our model to capture those observations .
While bibliographers only made a coarse distinction between spaced or nonspaced commas , in our model we generate medial comma spacing widths , sik , that are measured in pixels to enable ﬁner - grained analysis .
We use a simple multinomial parameterization where each pixel width is treated as a separate outcome up to some maximum allowable width : sik|ci∼Mult ( θci ) Here , θcrepresents the vector of multinomial spacing parameters corresponding to compositor c.
We choose this parameterization because it can capture non - unimodal whitespace preference distributions , as depicted in Figure 2 , and it makes learning simple .
3.3 Learning and Inference Modern and diplomatic words and spacing variables are observed , while compositor assignments are latent .
In order to ﬁt the model to an input document we estimate the orthographic preference parameters , wc , and spacing preference parameters , θc , for each compositor using EM .
The E - step is accomplished via a tractable sum over compositor assignments , while the M - step for wcis accomplished via gradient ascent ( Berg - Kirkpatrick et al . , 2010 ) .
The M - step for spacing parameters , θc , uses the standard multinomial update .
Predicting compositor groups is accomplished via an413

In all experiments we run 75 iterations of EM with 100 random restarts , choosing the learned parameters corresponding the best model likelihood .
4 Experiments Data : To evaluate our model when it has access to perfectly transcribed historical text , we use the Bodleian diplomatic transcription of the First Folio .3To
test whether our approach can also work with untranscribed books , we ran the Ocular OCR system ( Berg - Kirkpatrick et al . , 2013 ) on the Bodleian facsimile images to create an automatic diplomatic transcription .
In both cases , we used Ocular ’s estimates of glyph bounding boxes on the complete First Folio images to extract spacing information .
The modern text was taken from MIT Complete Works of Shakespeare4and was aligned with diplomatic transcriptions by running a word - level edit distance calculation .
The extracted substitutions form the model ’s observed modern - diplomatic word pairs .
Evaluation : To compare the recovered attribution with those proposed by bibliographers , we evaluate against an authoritative attribution compiled by Peter Blayney ( 1996 ) which includes the work of various scholars ( Hinman , 1963 ; HowardHill , 1973 , 1976 , 1980 ; Taylor , 1981 ; O’Connor , 1975 ; Werstine , 1982 ) .
We also evaluate our system against an earlier , highly inﬂuential model proposed by Hinman ( 1963 ) , which we approximate by reverting certain compositor divisions in Blayney ’s attribution .
Hinman ’s attribution posited ﬁve compositors , while Blayney ’s posited eight .
In experiments , we set the model ’s maximum number of compositors to C= 5when evaluating on Hinman ’s attribution , and use C= 8 3http://firstfolio.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/ 4http://shakespeare.mit.edu/with Blayney ’s .
We compute the one - to - one and many - to - one accuracy , mapping the recovered page groups to the gold compositors to maximize accuracy , as is standard for many unsupervised clustering tasks , e.g. POS induction ( see Christodoulopoulos et al . ( 2010 ) ) .
BASIC model variant : We evaluate a simple baseline model that uses a multinomial parameterization for generating diplomatic words and does not incorporate spacing information .
We use two different options for selection of spelling variants to be considered by the model .
First , we consider only the three words selected by Hinman : do , go andhere ( referred to as HINMAN ) .
Second , we use a larger , automatically selected , word list ( referred to as AUTO ) .
Here , we select all modern words with frequency greater than 70 that are not names and that exhibit sufﬁcient variance in diplomatic spellings ( most common diplomatic spelling occurs in less than 80 % of aligned tokens ) .
For our full model , described in the next section , we always use the larger AUTO word list .
FEAT model variant : We run experiments with several variants of our full model , described in Section 3 ( referred to as FEAT since they use a feature - based parameterization of diplomatic word generation . )
We try ablations of WORD and EDIT features , as well as model variants with and without the spacing generation component ( referred to as SPACE . )
We refer to the full model that includes both types of features and spacing generation as ALL .
5 Results Our experimental results are presented in Table 1 .
The BASIC variant , modeled after Hinman ’s original procedure , substantially outperforms the random baseline , with the HINMAN word list outperforming the larger AUTO word list .

Figure 3 : Learned behaviors of the Folio compositors .
Our model only detected the presence of ﬁve compositors ( ranked according to number of pages the compositor set in our model ’s prediction ) .
Compositor D ’s habit of omittingu(yong vs.young ) and compositor C ’s usage of spaced medial commas were also noticed in Taylor ( 1981 ) .
of the larger word list with feature - based models yields large gains in all scenarios , including evaluation on Hinman ’s original attributions and while using OCR diplomatic transcriptions .
The bestperforming model for both manually transcribed and OCR text uses EDIT features in conjunction with spacing generation and achieves an accuracy of up to 87 % .
Including WORD features on top of this leads to slightly reduced performance , perhaps as a result of the substantially increased number of free parameters .
In the OCR scenario , the addition of WORD features on top of EDIT decreases accuracy , unlike the same experiment with the manual transcription .
This is possibly a result of the reduced reliability of full word forms due to mistakes in OCR .
Particularly interesting is the result that spacing , rarely a factor considered in NLP models , improves the accuracy signiﬁcantly for our system when compared with EDIT features alone .
Because pixel - level visual information and arbitrary orthographic patterns are also the most difﬁcult features to measure manually , our results give strong evidence to the assertion that NLP - style models can aid bibliographers .
6 Discussion The results on OCR ( character error rate for most plays≈10−15 % ) transcripts are only marginally worse than those on manual transcripts , which shows that our approach can be generalized for the common case where manual diplomatic transcriptions are not available .
For our experiments , we also chose a common modern edition of Shakespeare instead of more carefully produced modernized transcription of the facsimile — our goal being to again show that this approach can be generalized , perhaps to documents where careful modernizations of the facsimile are not available .
Together , these results suggest that our model may be sufﬁciently robust to aid bibliographers in their analysis of less studied texts .
Figure 3 shows an example of the featureweights and spacing parameters learned by the FEAT w / ALL model .
Our statistical approach is able to successfully explain some of the observations scholars made .
For example , Taylor ( 1981 ) notices that compositors C and D prefer to omit uinyoung but A does not .
Our model reﬂects this by giving u→DEL high weight for D and low weight for A.
However , the weight of a single feature is difﬁcult to interpret in isolation .
This might be the reason why our model only moderately agrees in case of compositor C.
Another example can be seen in spacing patterns : according to Taylor ( 1981 ) , compositor C uses spaced medial commas unlike A and D. Our model learns the same behavior .
7 Conclusion Our primary goal is to scale the methods of compositor attribution , including both textual and visual modes of evidence , for use across books and corpora .
By using principled statistical techniques and considering evidence at a larger scale , we offer a more robust approach to compositor identiﬁcation than has previously been possible .
The fact that our system works well on OCR texts means that we are not restricted to only those documents for which we have manually produced transcriptions , opening up the possibility for bibliographic study on a much larger class of texts .
Though we are unable to incorporate the kinds of world knowledge used by bibliographers , our ability to include more information and more ﬁnegrained information allows us to recreate their results .
Having validated these techniques on the First Folio , where historical claims are well established , we hope future work can extend these methods and their application .
