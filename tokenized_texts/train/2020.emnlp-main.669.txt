Abstract We present C ODEX , a set of knowledge graph COmpletion Datasets EXtracted from Wikidata and Wikipedia that improve upon existing knowledge graph completion benchmarks in scope and level of difﬁculty .
In terms of scope , CODEXcomprises three knowledge graphs varying in size and structure , multilingual descriptions of entities and relations , and tens of thousands of hard negative triples that are plausible but veriﬁed to be false .
To characterize C ODEX , we contribute thorough empirical analyses and benchmarking experiments .
First , we analyze each C ODEXdataset in terms of logical relation patterns .
Next , we report baseline link prediction and triple classiﬁcation results on C ODEXfor ﬁve extensively tuned embedding models .
Finally , we differentiate CODEXfrom the popular FB15K-237 knowledge graph completion dataset by showing that CODEXcovers more diverse and interpretable content , and is a more difﬁcult link prediction benchmark .

1 Introduction Knowledge graphs are multi - relational graphs that express facts about the world by connecting entities ( people , places , things , concepts ) via different types of relationships .
The ﬁeld of automatic knowledge graph completion ( KGC ) , which is motivated by the fact that knowledge graphs are usually incomplete , is an active research direction spanning several subﬁelds of artiﬁcial intelligence ( Nickel et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ;
Ji et al . , 2020 ) .
As progress in artiﬁcial intelligence depends heavily on data , a relevant and high - quality benchmark is imperative to evaluating and advancing the state of the art in KGC .
However , the ﬁeld has largely remained static in this regard over the past decade .
Outdated subsets of Freebase ( Bollackeret al . , 2008 ) are most commonly used for evaluation in KGC , even though Freebase had known quality issues ( Tanon et al . , 2016 ) and was eventually deprecated in favor of the more recent Wikidata knowledge base ( Vrande ˇci´c and Krötzsch , 2014 ) .
Indeed , KGC benchmarks extracted from Freebase like FB15 K andFB15 K -237 ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ; Toutanova and Chen , 2015 ) are questionable in quality .
For example , FB15 K was shown to have train / test leakage ( Toutanova and Chen , 2015 ) .
Later in this paper ( § 6.2 ) , we will show that a relatively large proportion of relations in FB15 K -237 can be covered by a trivial frequency rule .
To address the need for a solid benchmark in KGC , we present CODEX , a set of knowledge graph COmpletion Datasets EXtracted from Wikidata and its sister project Wikipedia .
Inasmuch as Wikidata is considered the successor of Freebase , CODEXimproves upon existing Freebase - based KGC benchmarks in terms of scope and level of difﬁculty ( Table 1 ) .
Our contributions include : Foundations We survey evaluation datasets in encyclopedic knowledge graph completion to motivate a new benchmark ( § 2 and Appendix A ) .
Data We introduce CODEX , a benchmark consisting of three knowledge graphs varying in size and structure , entity types , multilingual labels and descriptions , and — unique to CODEX — manually veriﬁed hard negative triples ( § 3 ) .
To better understand CODEX , we analyze the logical relation patterns in each of its datasets ( § 4 ) .
Benchmarking We conduct large - scale model selection and benchmarking experiments , reporting baseline link prediction and triple classiﬁcation results on CODEXfor ﬁve widely used embedding models from different architectural classes ( § 5 ) .
Comparative analysis Finally , to demonstrate the unique value of CODEX , we differentiate
8329Table 1 : Qualitative comparison of C ODEXdatasets to existing Freebase - based KGC datasets ( § 2.1 ) .
Freebase variants ( FB15 K , FB15K-237 ) CODEXdatasets Scope ( domains ) Multi - domain , with a strong focus on awards , entertainment , and sports ( § 6.1 and Appendix E)Multi - domain , with focuses on writing , entertainment , music , politics , journalism , academics , and science ( § 6.1 and Appendix E ) Scope ( auxiliary data )
Various decentralized versions of FB15 K with , e.g. , entity types ( Xie et al . , 2016 ) , sampled negatives ( Socher et al . , 2013 ) , and more ( Table 8)Centralized repository of three datasets with entity types , multilingual text , and manually annotated hard negatives ( § 3 ) Level of difﬁculty FB15 K has severe train / test leakage from inverse relations ( Toutanova and Chen , 2015 ) ; while removal of inverse relations makes FB15 K -237 harder than FB15 K , FB15 K -237 still has a high proportion of easy - to - predict relational patterns ( § 6.2)Inverse relations removed from all datasets to avoid train / test leakage ( § 3.2 ) ; manually annotated hard negatives for the task of triple classiﬁcation ( § 3.4 ) ; few trivial patterns for the task of link prediction ( § 6.2 ) CODEXfrom FB15 K -237 in terms of both content and difﬁculty ( § 6 ) .
We show that CODEXcovers more diverse and interpretable content , and is a more challenging link prediction benchmark .
2 Existing datasets We begin by surveying existing KGC benchmarks .
Table 8 in Appendix A provides an overview of evaluation datasets and tasks on a per - paper basis across the artiﬁcial intelligence , machine learning , and natural language processing communities .
Note that we focus on data rather than models , so we only overview relevant evaluation benchmarks here .
For more on existing KGC models , both neural and symbolic , we refer the reader to ( Meilicke et al . , 2018 ) and ( Ji et al . , 2020 ) .
2.1 Freebase extracts These datasets , extracted from the Freebase knowledge graph ( Bollacker et al . , 2008 ) , are the most popular for KGC ( see Table 8 in Appendix A ) .
FB15 K was introduced by Bordes et al .
( 2013 ) .
It contains 14,951 entities , 1,345 relations , and 592,213 triples covering several domains , with a strong focus on awards , entertainment , and sports .
FB15K-237 was introduced by Toutanova and Chen ( 2015 ) to remedy data leakage in FB15 K , which contains many test triples that invert triples in the training set .
FB15 K -237 contains 14,541 entities , 237 relations , and 310,116 triples .
We compare FB15K-237 to C ODEXin § 6 to assess each dataset ’s content and relative difﬁculty .
2.2 Other encyclopedic datasets NELL-995 ( Xiong et al . , 2017 ) was taken from the Never Ending Language Learner ( NELL ) sys - tem ( Mitchell et al . , 2018 ) , which continuously reads the web to obtain and update its knowledge .
NELL-995 , a subset of the 995th iteration of NELL , contains 75,492 entities , 200 relations , and 154,213 triples .
While NELL-995 is general and covers many domains , its mean average precision was less than 50 % around its 1000th iteration ( Mitchell et al . , 2018 ) .
A cursory inspection reveals that many of the triples in NELL-995 are nonsensical or overly generic , suggesting that NELL-995 is not a meaningful dataset for KGC evaluation.1 YAGO3 - 10 ( Dettmers et al . , 2018 ) is a subset of YAGO3 ( Mahdisoltani et al . , 2014 ) , which covers portions of Wikipedia , Wikidata , and WordNet .
YAGO3 - 10 has 123,182 entities , 37 relations , and 1,089,040 triples mostly limited to facts about people and locations .
While YAGO3 - 10 is a highprecision dataset , it was recently shown to be too easy for link prediction because it contains a large proportion of duplicate relations ( Akrami et al . , 2020 ;
Pezeshkpour et al . , 2020 ) .
2.3 Domain - speciﬁc datasets In addition to large encyclopedic knowledge graphs , it is common to evaluate KGC methods on at least one smaller , domain - speciﬁc dataset , typically drawn from the WordNet semantic network ( Miller , 1998 ; Bordes et al . , 2013 ) .
Other choices include the Uniﬁed Medical Language System ( UMLS ) database ( McCray , 2003 ) , the Alyawarra kinship dataset ( Kemp et al . , 2006 ) , theCountries dataset ( Bouchard et al . , 2015 ) , and variants of a synthetic “ family tree ” ( Hinton , 1986 ) .
As our focus in this paper is encyclopedic knowledge , we do not cover these datasets further .

For reference , we deﬁne a knowledge graph Gas a multi - relational graph consisting of a set of entities E , relations R , and factual statements in the form of ( head , relation , tail ) triples ( h ; r ; t ) 2ERE. 3.1 Seeding the collection We collected an initial set of triples using a type of snowball sampling ( Goodman , 1961 ) .
We ﬁrst manually deﬁned a broad seed set of entity and relation types common to 13 domains : Business , geography , literature , media and entertainment , medicine , music , news , politics , religion , science , sports , travel , and visual art .
Examples of seed entity types include airline , journalist , and religious text ; corresponding seed relation types in each respective domain include airline alliance , notable works , and language of work or name .
Table 9 in Appendix B gives all seed entity and relation types .
Using these seeds , we retrieved an initial set of 380,038 entities , 75 relations , and 1,156,222 triples by querying Wikidata for statements of the form ( head entity of seed type , seed relation type , ? ) .
3.2 Filtering the collection To create smaller data snapshots , we ﬁltered the initial 1.15 million triples to k - cores , which are maximal subgraphs G0of a given graph Gsuch that every node in G0has a degree of at least k(Batagelj and Zaveršnik , 2011).2We constructed three C ODEXdatasets ( Table 2 ): CODEX - S(k= 15 ) , which has 36k triples .
Because of its smaller size , we recommend thatCODEX - Sbe used for model testing and debugging , as well as evaluation of methods that are less computationally efﬁcient ( e.g. , symbolic search - based approaches ) .
2A similar approach was used to extract the FB15 K dataset from Freebase ( Bordes et al . , 2013).CODEX - M(k= 10 ) , which has 206k triples .
CODEX - Mis all - purpose , being comparable in size to FB15 K -237 ( § 2.1 ) , one of the most popular benchmarks for KGC evaluation .
CODEX - L(k= 5 ) , which has 612k triples .
CODEX - Lis comparable in size to FB15 K ( § 2.1 ) , and can be used for both general evaluation and “ few - shot ” evaluation .
We also release the raw dump that we collected via snowball sampling , but focus on CODEX - S through L for the remainder of this paper .
To minimize train / test leakage , we removed inverse relations from each dataset ( Toutanova and Chen , 2015 ) .
We computed ( head , tail ) and ( tail , head ) overlap between all pairs of relations , and removed each relation whose entity pair set overlapped with that of another relation more than 50%of the time .
Finally , we split each dataset into 90/5/5 train / validation / test triples such that the validation and test sets contained only entities and relations seen in the respective training sets .
3.3 Auxiliary information An advantage of Wikidata is that it links entities and relations to various sources of rich auxiliary information .
To enable tasks that involve joint learning over knowledge graph structure and such additional information , we collected : Entity types for each entity as given by Wikidata ’s instance of andsubclass of relations ; Wikidata labels and descriptions for entities , relations , and entity types ; and Wikipedia page extracts ( introduction sections ) for entities and entity types .
For the latter two , we collected text where available in Arabic , German , English , Spanish , Russian , and Chinese .
We chose these languages because they are all relatively well - represented on Wikidata ( Kaffee et al . , 2017 ) .
Table 2 provides the coverage by language for each C ODEXdataset .

3.4 Hard negatives for evaluation Knowledge graphs are unique in that they only contain positive statements , meaning that triples not observed in a given knowledge graph are not necessarily false , but merely unseen ; this is called the Open World Assumption ( Galárraga et al . , 2013 ) .
However , most machine learning tasks on knowledge graphs require negatives in some capacity .
While different negative sampling strategies exist ( Cai and Wang , 2018 ) , the most common approach is to randomly perturb observed triples to generate negatives , following Bordes et al .
( 2013 ) .
While random negative sampling is beneﬁcial and even necessary in the case where a large number of negatives is needed ( i.e. , training ) , it is not necessarily useful for evaluation .
For example , in the task of triple classiﬁcation , the goal is to discriminate between positive ( true ) and negative ( false ) triples .
As we show in § 5.5 , triple classiﬁcation over randomly generated negatives is trivially easy for state - of - the - art models because random negatives are generally not meaningful or plausible .
Therefore , we generate and manually evaluate hard negatives for KGC evaluation .
Generation To generate hard negatives , we used each pre - trained embedding model from § 5.2 to predict tail entities of triples in CODEX .
For each model , we took as candidate negatives the triples ( h ; r;^t)for which ( i ) the type of the predicted tail entity ^tmatched the type of the true tail entity t ; ( ii)^twas ranked in the top-10 predictions by that model ; and ( iii ) ( h ; r;^t)was not observed in G. Annotation We manually labeled all candidate negative triples generated for CODEX - Sand CODEX - Mastrue orfalse using the guidelines provided in Appendix C.3We randomly selected among the triples labeled as false to create validation and test negatives for C ODEX - S and CODEX - M , examples of which are given in Ta3We are currently investigating methods for obtaining highquality crowdsourced annotations of negatives for CODEX-L.ble 3 .
To assess the quality of our annotations , we gathered judgments from two independent native English speakers on a random selection of 100 candidate negatives .
The annotators were provided the instructions from Appendix C. On average , our labels agreed with those of the annotators 89.5 % of the time .
Among the disagreements , 81 % of the time we assigned the label truewhereas the annotator assigned the label false , meaning that we were comparatively conservative in labeling negatives .
4 Analysis of relation patterns To give an idea of the types of reasoning necessary for models to perform well on CODEX , we analyze the presence of learnable binary relation patterns within CODEX .
The three main types of such patterns in knowledge graphs are symmetry , inversion , and compositionality ( Trouillon et
al . , 2019 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ) .
We address symmetry and compositionality here , and omit inversion because we speciﬁcally removed inverse relations to avoid train / test leakage ( § 3.2 ) .
4.1 Symmetry Symmetric relations are relations rfor which ( h ; r ; t ) 2Gimplies ( t ; r ; h ) 2G.
For each relation , we compute the number of its ( head , tail ) pairs that overlap with its ( tail , head ) pairs , divided by the total number of pairs , and take those with 50 % overlap or higher as symmetric .
CODEXdatasets have ﬁve such relations : diplomatic relation , shares border with , sibling , spouse , and unmarried partner .
Table 4 gives the proportion of triples containing symmetric relations per dataset .
Symmetric patterns are more prevalent in CODEX - S , whereas the larger datasets are mostly antisymmetric , i.e. , ( h ; r ; t ) 2Gimplies ( t ; r ; h ) 62G. 4.2 Composition Compositionality captures path rules of the form ( h ; r 1 ; x1 ) ; : : : ; ( xn ; rn ; t)!(h ; r ; t ) .
To learn these rules , models must be capable of “ multi - hop ” reasoning on knowledge graphs ( Guu et al . , 2015 ) .
8332Table 4 : Relation patterns in C ODEX .
For symmetry , we give the proportion of triples containing a symmetric relation .
For composition , we give the proportion of triples participating in a rule of length two or three .
CODEX - S C ODEX - M C ODEX - L Symmetry 17.46 % 4.01 % 3.29 % Composition 10.09 % 16.55 % 31.84 % To identify compositional paths , we use the AMIE3 system ( Lajus et al . , 2020 ) , which outputs rules with conﬁdence scores that capture how many times those rules are seen versus violated , to identify paths of lengths two and three ; we omit longer paths as they are relatively costly to compute .
We identify 26 , 44 , and 93 rules in CODEX - S , CODEX - M , and CODEX - L , respectively , with average conﬁdence ( out of 1 ) of 0.630 , 0.556 , and 0.459 .
Table 4 gives the percentage of triples per dataset participating in a discovered rule .
Evidently , composition is especially prevalent in CODEX - L. An example rule in CODEX - Lis “ if Xwas founded by Y , and Y ’s country of citizenship is Z ,
then the country [ i.e. , of origin ] of Xis Z ” ( conﬁdence 0.709 ) .
We release these rules as part of CODEXfor further development of KGC methodologies that incorporate or learn rules .
5
Benchmarking Next , we benchmark performance on CODEXfor the tasks of link prediction and triple classiﬁcation .
To ensure that models are fairly and accurately compared , we follow Rufﬁnelli et al .
( 2020 ) , who conducted what is ( to the best of our knowledge ) the largest - scale hyperparameter tuning study of knowledge graph embeddings to date .
Note that CODEXcan be used to evaluate any type of KGC method .
However , we focus on embeddings in this section due to their widespread usage in modern NLP ( Ji et al . , 2020 ) .
5.1 Tasks Link prediction The link prediction task is conducted as follows : Given a test triple ( h ; r ; t ) , we construct queries ( ? ; r ; t)and(h ; r ; ? ) .
For each query , a model scores candidate head ( tail ) entities ^h(^t ) according to its belief that ^h(^t ) completes the triple ( i.e. , answers the query ) .
The goal is of link prediction is to rank true triples ( ^h ; r ; t ) or(h ; r;^t ) higher than false and unseen triples .
Link prediction performance is evaluated withmean reciprocal rank ( MRR ) and hits@ k. MRR is the average reciprocal of each ground - truth entity ’s rank over all ( ? ; r ; t)and(h ; r;?)test triples .
Hits@ kmeasures the proportion of test triples for which the ground - truth entity is ranked in the top - kpredicted entities .
In computing these metrics , we exclude the predicted entities for which ( ^h ; r ; t ) 2Gor(h ; r;^t)2Gso that known positive triples do not artiﬁcially lower ranking scores .
This is called “ ﬁltering ” ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ) .
Triple classiﬁcation Given a triple ( h ; r ; t ) , the goal of triple classiﬁcation is to predict a corresponding label y2 f  1;1 g. Since knowledge graph embedding models output real - valued scores for triples , we convert these scores into labels by selecting a decision threshold per relation on the validation set such that validation accuracy is maximized for the model in question .
A similar approach was used by Socher et al .
( 2013 ) .
We compare results on three sets of evaluation negatives : ( 1 ) We generate one negative per positive by replacing the positive triple ’s tail entity by a tail entity t0sampled uniformly at random ; ( 2 ) We generate negatives by sampling tail entities according to their relative frequency in the tail slotof all triples ; and ( 3 ) We use the CODEXhard negatives .
We measure accuracy andF1 score .
5.2 Models We compare the following embedding methods : RESCAL ( Nickel et al . , 2011 ) , TransE ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ) , ComplEx ( Trouillon et al . , 2016 ) , ConvE ( Dettmers et al . , 2018 ) , and TuckER ( Balazevic et al . , 2019b ) .
These models represent several classes of architecture , from linear ( RESCAL , TuckER , ComplEx ) to translational ( TransE ) to nonlinear / learned ( ConvE ) .
Appendix D provides more speciﬁcs on each model .
5.3 Model selection As recent studies have observed that training strategies are equally , if not more , important than architecture for link prediction ( Kadlec et al . , 2017 ; Lacroix et al . , 2018 ; Rufﬁnelli et al . , 2020 ) , we search across a large range of hyperparameters to ensure a truly fair comparison .
To this end we use the PyTorch - based LibKGE framework for training and selecting knowledge graph embeddings.4In the remainder of this section we outline the most important parameters of our model selection process .

All experiments were run on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 16 GB of RAM .
Training negatives Given a set of positive training triplesf(h ; r ; t ) g , we compare three types of negative sampling strategy implemented by LibKGE : ( a ) NegSamp , or randomly corrupting head entities hor tail entities tto create negatives ; ( b)1vsAll , or treating allpossible head / tail corruptions of ( h ; r ; t ) as negatives , including the corruptions that are actually positives ; and ( c ) KvsAll , or treating batches of head / tail corruptions notseen in the knowledge graph as negatives .
Loss functions We consider the following loss functions : ( i ) MR or margin ranking , which aims to maximize a margin between positive and negative triples ; ( ii ) BCE or binary cross - entropy , which is computed by applying the logistic sigmoid to triple scores ; and ( iii ) CEor cross - entropy between the softmax over the entire distribution of triple scores and the label distribution over all triples , normalized to sum to one .
Search strategies We select models using the Ax platform , which supports hyperparameter search using both quasi - random sequences of generated conﬁgurations and Bayesian optimization ( BO ) with Gaussian processes.5At a high level , for each dataset and model , we generate both quasirandom and BO trials per negative sampling and loss function combination , ensuring that we search over a wide range of hyperparameters for different types of training strategy .
Appendix F provides speciﬁc details on the search strategy for each dataset , which was determined according to resource constraints and observed performance patterns .
5https://ax.dev/ Figure 1 : Distribution of validation MRR , C ODEX - M. 5.4 Link prediction results Table 5 gives link prediction results .
We ﬁnd that ComplEx is the best at modeling symmetry and antisymmetry , and indeed it was designed speciﬁcally to improve upon bilinear models that do not capture symmetry , like DistMult ( Trouillon et al . , 2016 ) .
As such , it performs the best on CODEX - S , which has the highest proportion of symmetric relations .
For example , on the most frequent symmetric relation ( diplomatic relation ) , ComplEx achieves 0.859 MRR , compared to 0.793 for ConvE , 0.490 for RESCAL , and 0.281 for TransE.
By contrast , TuckER is strongest at modeling compositional relations , so it performs best on CODEX - L , which has a high degree of compositionality .
For example , on the most frequent compositional relation in CODEX - L(languages spoken , written , or signed ) , TuckER achieves 0.465 MRR , compared to 0.464 for RESCAL , 0.463 for ConvE , 0.456 for ComplEx , and 0.385 for TransE.
By contrast , since CODEX - Mis mostly asymmetric and non - compositional , ComplEx performs best because of its ability to model asymmetry .
Effect of hyperparameters As shown by Figure 1 , hyperparameters have a strong impact on link prediction performance : Validation MRR for all models varies by over 30 percentage points depending on the training strategy and input conﬁguration .
This ﬁnding is consistent with previous observations in the literature ( Kadlec et al . , 2017 ; Rufﬁnelli et al . , 2020 ) .
Appendix F provides the best conﬁgurations for each model .

Each model consistently achieved its respective peak performance with cross - entropy ( CE ) loss , a ﬁnding which is corroborated by several other KGC comparison papers ( Kadlec et al . , 2017 ; Rufﬁnelli et al . , 2020 ; Jain et al . , 2020 ) .
As far as negative sampling techniques , we do not ﬁnd that a single strategy is dominant , suggesting that the choice of loss function is more important .
5.5 Triple classiﬁcation results Table 6 gives triple classiﬁcation results .
Evidently , triple classiﬁcation on randomly generated negatives is a nearly - solved task .
On negatives generated uniformly at random , performance scores are nearly identical at almost 100 % accuracy .
Even with a negative sampling strategy “ smarter ” than uniform random , all models perform well .
Hard negatives Classiﬁcation performance degenerates considerably on our hard negatives , around 8 to 11 percentage points from relative frequency - based sampling and 13 to 19 percentage points from uniformly random sampling .
Relative performance also varies :
In contrast to our link prediction task in which ComplEx and TuckER were by far the strongest models , RESCAL is slightly stronger on the CODEX - Shard negatives , whereas ConvE performs best on the CODEX - Mhard negatives .
These results indicate that triple classiﬁcation is indeed a distinct task that requires different architectures and , in many cases , different training strategies ( Appendix F ) .
We believe that few recent works use triple classiﬁcation as an evaluation task because of the lack of true hard negatives in existing benchmarks .
Early works reported high triple classiﬁcation accuracy on sampled negatives ( Socher et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) , perhaps leading the community to believe that the task was nearly solved .
However , our results demonstrate that the task is far from solvedwhen the negatives are plausible but truly false .
6 Comparative case study Finally , we conduct a comparative analysis between CODEX - Mand FB15 K -237 ( § 2.1 ) to demonstrate the unique value of CODEX .
We choose FB15 K -237 because it is the most popular encyclopedic KGC benchmark after FB15 K , which was already shown to be an easy dataset by Toutanova and Chen ( 2015 ) .
We choose CODEX - Mbecause it is the closest in size to FB15K-237 .
6.1 Content We ﬁrst compare the content in CODEX - M , which is extracted from Wikidata , with that of FB15 K 237 , which is extracted from Freebase .
For brevity , Figure 2 compares the top-15 relations by mention count in the two datasets .
Appendix E provides more content comparisons .
Diversity The most common relation in CODEXMisoccupation , which is because most people on Wikidata have multiple occupations listed .
By contrast , the frequent relations in FB15 K -237 are mostly related to awards and ﬁlm .
In fact , over 25 % of all triples in FB15 K -237 belong to the /award relation domain , suggesting that C ODEXcovers a more diverse selection of content .
Interpretability The Freebase - style relations are also arguably less interpretable than those in Wikidata .
Whereas Wikidata relations have concise natural language labels , the Freebase relation labels are hierarchical , often at ﬁve or six levels of hierarchy ( Figure 2 ) .
Moreover , all relations in Wikidata are binary , whereas some Freebase relations aren - nary ( Tanon et al . , 2016 ) , meaning that they connect more than two entities .
The relations containing a dot ( “ . ” ) are such n - nary relations , and are difﬁcult to reason about without understanding the structure of Freebase , which has been deprecated .
8335 Figure 2 : Top-15 most frequent relations in C ODEX - M and FB15K-237 .
We further discuss the impact of such n - nary relations for link prediction in the following section .
6.2 Difﬁculty Next , we compare the datasets in a link prediction task to show that C ODEX - M is more difﬁcult .
Baseline We devise a “ non - learning ” link prediction baseline .
Let ( h ; r;?)be a test query .
Our baseline scores candidate tail entities by their relative frequency in the tail slot of all training triples mentioning r , ﬁltering out tail entities tfor which ( h ; r ; t ) is already observed in the training set .
If all tail entities tare ﬁltered out , we score entities by frequency before ﬁltering .
The logic of our approach works in reverse for ( ? ; r ; t)queries .
In evaluating our baseline , we follow LibKGE ’s protocol for breaking ties in ranking ( i.e. , for entities that appear with equal frequency ) by taking the mean rank of all entities with the same score .
Setup We compare our baseline to the best pretrained embedding model per dataset : RESCAL for FB15 K -237 , which was released by Rufﬁnelli et al .
( 2020 ) , and ComplEx for CODEX - M. We evaluate performance with MRR and Hits@10 .
Beyond overall performance , we also compute per - relation improvement of the respective embedding over our baseline in terms of percentage points MRR .
This measures the amount of learning beyond frequency statistics necessary for each relation .
Results and discussion Table 7 compares the overall performance of our baseline versus the best embedding per dataset , and Figure 3 shows the improvement of the respective embedding over our baseline per relation type on each dataset .
The improvement of the embedding is much smaller on FB15 K -237 than CODEX - M , and in fact our baseline performs on par with or even outperforms theTable 7 : Overall performance ( MRR ) of our frequency baseline versus the best embedding nodel per benchmark .
“ Improvement ” refers to the improvement of the embedding over the baseline .
Baseline Embedding Improvement FB15K-237 0.236 0.356 +0.120 CODEX - M 0.135 0.337 +0.202 Figure 3 : Improvement in MRR of the embedding over our frequency baseline per relation type .

The medians are 8.27 and 20.04 percentage points on FB15K-237 and C ODEX - M , respectively .
embedding on FB15 K -237 for some relation types .
To further explore these cases , Figure 4 gives the empirical cumulative distribution function of improvement , which shows the percentage of test triples for which the level of improvement is less than or equal to a given value on each dataset .
Surprisingly , the improvement for both MRR and Hits@10 is less than ﬁve percentage points for nearly 40 % ofFB15 K -237 ’s test set , and is zero or negative 15%of the time .
By contrast , our baseline is signiﬁcantly weaker than the strongest embedding method on C ODEX - M.
The disparity in improvement is due to two relation patterns prevalent in FB15K-237 :
8336 Figure 4 : Empirical CDF of improvement of the best embedding over our frequency baseline .
Skewed relations FB15 K -237 contains many relations that are skewed toward a single head or tail entity .
For example , our baseline achieves perfect performance over all ( h ; r ; ? ) queries for the /common / topic / webpage .
/common / webpage / category relation because this relation has only oneunique tail entity .
Another example of a highly skewed relation inFB15 K -237 is /people / person / gender , for which 78.41 % of tails are the entity male .
In fact , 11 relations in FB15 K -237 have only one unique tail entity , accounting for 3.22 % of all tail queries in FB15 K -237 .
Overall , 15.98 % of test triples in FB15 K -237 contain relations that are skewed 50 % or more toward a single head or tail entity , whereas only 1.26 % of test triples in CODEX - Mcontain such skewed relations .
Fixed - set relations Around 12.7 % of test queries in FB15 K -237 contain relation types that connect entities to ﬁxed sets of values .
As an example , each head entity that participates in the FB15 K -237 relation /travel / travel_destination / climate./travel/ travel_destination_monthly_climate / month is connected to the same 12 tails ( months of the year ) throughout train , validation , and test .
This makes prediction trivial with our baseline : By ﬁltering out the tail entities already seen in train , only a few ( or even one ) candidate tail(s ) are left in test , and the answer is guaranteed to be within these candidates .
These relations only occur in FB15 K -237 because of the way the dataset was constructed from Freebase .
Speciﬁcally , Freebase used a special type of entity called Compound Value Type ( CVT ) as an intermediary node connecting n - ary relations .
Binary relations were created by traversing through CVTs , yielding some relations that connect entities to ﬁxed sets of values .
We conclude that while FB15 K -237 is a valuable dataset , CODEXis more appropriately difﬁcult for link prediction .
Additionally , we note that in FB15 K -237 , all validation and test triples containing entity pairs directly linked in the training set were deleted ( Toutanova and Chen , 2015 ) , meaning that symmetry can not be tested for in FB15 K -237 .
Given that CODEXdatasets contain both symmetry and compositionality , CODEXis more suitable for assessing how well models can learn relation patterns that go beyond frequency .
7 Conclusion and outlook We present CODEX , a set of knowledge graph COmpletion Datasets EXtracted from Wikidata and Wikipedia , and show that CODEXis suitable for multiple KGC tasks .
We release data , code , and pretrained models for use by the community at https://bit.ly/2EPbrJs .
Some promising future directions on C ODEXinclude : Better model understanding CODEXcan be used to analyze the impact of hyperparameters , training strategies , and model architectures in KGC tasks .
Revival of triple classiﬁcation We encourage the use of triple classiﬁcation on CODEX in addition to link prediction because it directly tests discriminative power .
Fusing text and structure Including text in both the link prediction and triple classiﬁcation tasks should substantially improve performance ( Toutanova et al . , 2015 ) .
Furthermore , text can be used for few - shot link prediction , an emerging research direction ( Xiong et al . , 2017 ; Shi and Weninger , 2017 ) .
Overall , we hope that CODEXwill provide a boost to research in KGC , which will in turn impact many other ﬁelds of artiﬁcial intelligence .

8340A Literature review Table 8 provides an overview of knowledge graph embedding papers with respect to datasets and evaluation tasks .
In our review , we only consider papers published between 2014 and 2020 in the main proceedings of conferences where KGC embedding papers are most likely to appear : Artiﬁcial intelligence ( AAAI , IJCAI ) , machine learning ( ICML , ICLR , NeurIPS ) , and natural language processing ( ACL , EMNLP , NAACL ) .
The main evaluation benchmarks are FB15 K ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ) , WN18 ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ) , FB15K-237 ( Toutanova and Chen , 2015 ) , WN18RR ( Dettmers et al . , 2018 ) , FB13 ( Socher et al . , 2013 ) , WN11 ( Socher et al . , 2013 ) , NELL995(Xiong et
al . , 2017 ) , YAGO3 - 10 ( Dettmers et al . , 2018 ) , Countries ( Bouchard et al . , 2015 ) .
UMLS ( McCray , 2003 ) , Kinship ( Kemp et al . , 2006 ) , Families ( Hinton , 1986 ) , and other versions ofNELL ( Mitchell et al . , 2018 ) .
B Seeds for data collection Table 9 provides all seed entity and relation types used to collect CODEX .
Each type is given ﬁrst by its natural language label and then by its Wikidata unique ID : Entity IDs begin with Q , whereas relation ( property ) IDs begin with P.
For the entity types that apply to people ( e.g. , actor , musician , journalist ) , we retrieved seed entities by querying Wikidata using the occupation relation .
For the entity types that apply to things ( e.g. , airline , disease , tourist attraction ) , we retrieved seed entities by querying Wikidata using the instance of and subclass of relations .
C Negative annotation guidelines We provide the annotation guidelines we used to label candidate negative triples ( § 3.4 ) .
Task You must label each triple as either trueor false .
To help you ﬁnd the answer , we have provided you with Wikipedia and Wikidata links for the entities and relations in each triple .
You may also search on Google for the answer , although most claims should be resolvable using Wikipedia and Wikidata alone .
If you are not able to ﬁnd any reliable , speciﬁc , clear information supporting the claim , choose false .
You may explain your reasoning if need be or provide sources to back up your answer in the optional explanation column .
Examples False triples may have problems with grammar , factual content , or both .
Examples of grammatically incorrect triples are those whose entity or relation types do not make sense , for example : (United States of America , continent , science ﬁction writer ) (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , medical condition , British Raj )
(Canada , foundational text , Vietnamese cuisine )
Examples of grammatically correct but factually false triples include : (United States of America , continent , Europe ) (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , country of citizenship , Argentina ) (Canada , foundational text , Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ) (Alexander Pushkin , inﬂuenced by , Leo Tolstoy ) — Pushkin died only a few years after Tolstoy was born , so this sentence is unlikely .
Notice that in the latter examples , the entity types match up , but the statements are still false .
Tips For triples about people ’s occupation and genre , try to be as speciﬁc as possible .
For example , if the triple says ( < person > , occupation , guitarist ) but that person is mainly known for their singing , choose false , even if that person plays the guitar .
Likewise , if a triple says ( < person > , genre , classical ) but they are mostly known for jazz music , choose false even if , for example , that person had classical training in their childhood .
D Embedding models We brieﬂy overview the ﬁve models compared in our link prediction and triple classiﬁcation tasks .
RESCAL ( Nickel et al . , 2011 ) was one of the ﬁrst knowledge graph embedding models .
Although it is not often used as a baseline , Rufﬁnelli et al .
( 2020 ) showed that it is competitive when appropriately tuned .
RESCAL treats relational learning as tensor decomposition , scoring entity embeddings h;r2 Rdeand relation embeddings R2Rdedewith the bilinear form h > Rt .

TransE is likely the most popular baseline for KGC tasks and the most inﬂuential of all KGC embedding papers .
ComplEx ( Trouillon et al . , 2016 ) uses a bilinear function to score triples with a diagonal relation embedding matrix and complex - valued embeddings .
Its scoring function is re  h > diag(r)t , where tis the complex conjugate of tand
re denotes the real part of a complex number .
ConvE ( Dettmers et al . , 2018 ) is one of the ﬁrst and most popular nonlinear models for KGC .
It concatenates head and relation embeddings h andrinto a two - dimensional “ image ” , applies a pointwise linearity over convolutional and fullyconnected layers , and multiplies the result with the tail embedding tto obtain a score .
Formally , its scoring function is given as f(vec(f([h;r] ! ) ) W)t , where fis a nonlinearity ( originally , ReLU ) , [ h;r]denotes a concatenation and twodimensional reshaping of the head and relation embeddings , ! denotes the ﬁlters of the convolutional layer , and vecdenotes the ﬂattening of a two - dimensional matrix .
TuckER ( Balazevic et al . , 2019b ) is a linear model based on the Tucker tensor decomposition , which factorizes a tensor into three lower - rank matrices and a core tensor .
The TuckER scoring function for a single triple ( h ; r ; t ) is given asW 1h2r3 t , whereWis the mode - three core tensor that is shared among all entity and relation embeddings , andndenotes the tensor product along the nth mode of the tensor .
TuckER can be seen as a generalized form of other linear KGC embedding models like RESCAL and ComplEx .
E Content comparison We provide additional comparison of the contents in C ODEX - M and FB15K-237 .
Figure 5 , which plots the top-30 entities by frequency in the two benchmarks , demonstrates that both dataset are biased toward developed Western countries and cultures .
However , CODEX - Mis more diverse in domain .
It covers academia , entertainment , journalism , politics , science , and writing , whereas FB15 K -237 covers mostly entertaiment and sports .
FB15 K -237 is also much more biased toward the United States in particular , as ﬁve of its top-30 entities are speciﬁc to the US : United States of America , United States dollar , New York City ,

Los Angeles , and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development .
Figure 6 compares the top-15 entity types in CODEX - MandFB15 K -237 .
Again , CODEX - M is diverse , covering people , places , organizations , movies , and abstract concepts , whereas FB15 K 237 has many overlapping entity types mostly about entertainment .
F Hyperparameter search Table 10 gives our hyperparameter search space .
Tables 11 , 12 , and 13 report the best hyperparameter conﬁgurations for link prediction on CODEX - S , CODEX - M , and CODEX - L , respectively .
Tables 14 and 15 report the best hyperparameter conﬁgurations for triple classiﬁcation on the hard negatives in C ODEX - S and C ODEX - M , respectively .
Terminology
For embedding initialization , Xv refers to Xavier initialization ( Glorot and Bengio , 2010 ) .
The reciprocal relations model refers to learning separate relation embeddings for queries in the direction of ( h ; r;?)versus ( ? ; r ; t)(Kazemi and Poole , 2018 ) .
The frequency weighting regularization technique refers to regularizing embeddings by the relative frequency of the corresponding entity or relation in the training data .
8344Search strategies Recall that we select models using Ax , which supports hyperparameter search using both quasi - random sequences of generated conﬁgurations and Bayesian optimization ( BO ) .
The search strategy for each CODEXdataset is as follows : CODEX - S : Per negative sampling type / loss combination , we generate 30 quasi - random trials followed by 10 BO trials .
We select the best - performing model by validation MRR over all such combinations .
In each trial , the model is trained for a maximum of 400 epochs with an early stopping patience of 5 .
We also terminate a trial after 50 epochs if the model does not reach0.05 MRR .
CODEX - M : Per negative sampling type / loss combination , we generate 20 quasi - random trials .
The maximum number of epochs and early stopping criteria are the same as for CODEX - S.CODEX - L : Per negative sampling type / loss combination , we generate 10 quasi - random trials of 20 training epochs instead of 400 .
We reduce the number of epochs to limit resource usage .
In most cases , MRR plateaus after 2030 epochs , an observation which is consistent with ( Rufﬁnelli et al . , 2020 ) .
Then , we take the best - performing model by validation MRR over all such combinations , and retrain that model for a maximum of 400 epochs .
Note that we search using MRR as our metric , but the triple classiﬁcation task measures 0/1 accuracy , not ranking performance .
For triple classiﬁcation , we choose the model with the highest validation accuracy among the pre - trained models across all negative sampling type / loss function combinations .
We release all pretrained LibKGE models and accompanying conﬁguration ﬁles in the centralized CODEXrepository .
8345Table 10 : Our hyperparameter search space .
We follow the naming conventions and ranges given by Rufﬁnelli et al .
( 2020 ) , and explain the meanings of selected hyperparameter settings in Appendix F. As most KGC embedding models have a wide range of conﬁguration options , we encourage future work to follow this tabular scheme for transparent reporting of implementation details .
