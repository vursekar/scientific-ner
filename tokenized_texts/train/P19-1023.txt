Abstract We study relation extraction for knowledge base ( KB ) enrichment .
SpeciÔ¨Åcally , we aim to extract entities and their relationships from sentences in the form of triples and map the elements of the extracted triples to an existing KB in an end - to - end manner .
Previous studies focus on the extraction itself and rely on Named Entity Disambiguation ( NED ) to map triples into the KB space .
This way , NED errors may cause extraction errors that affect the overall precision and recall .
To address this problem , we propose an end - to - end relation extraction model for KB enrichment based on a neural encoder - decoder model .
We collect high - quality training data by distant supervision with co - reference resolution and paraphrase detection .
We propose an n - gram based attention model that captures multi - word entity names in a sentence .
Our model employs jointly learned word and entity embeddings to support named entity disambiguation .
Finally , our model uses a modiÔ¨Åed beam search and a triple classiÔ¨Åer to help generate high - quality triples .
Our model outperforms state - of - theart baselines by 15:51 % and8:38 % in terms of F1 score on two real - world datasets .
1 Introduction Knowledge bases ( KBs ) , often in the form of knowledge graphs ( KGs ) , have become essential resources in many tasks including Q&A systems , recommender system , and natural language generation .
Large KBs such as DBpedia ( Auer et al . , 2007 ) , Wikidata ( Vrandecic and Kr ¬®otzsch , 2014 ) and Yago ( Suchanek et al . , 2007 ) contain millions of facts about entities , which are represented in the form of subject - predicate - object triples .
However , these KBs are far from complete and mandate continuous enrichment and curation .

Input sentence : " New York University is a private university in Manhattan . "
Unsupervised approach output : hNYU , is , private university i hNYU , is private university in ,
Manhattan i Supervised approach output : hNYU , instance of ,
Private University i hNYU , located in , Manhattan i Canonicalized output : hQ49210 , P31 , Q902104 i
hQ49210 , P131 , Q11299 i Table 1 : Relation extraction example .
Previous studies work on embedding - based model ( Nguyen et al . , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ) and entity alignment model ( Chen et al . , 2017 ; Sun et al . , 2017 ; Trisedya et al . , 2019 ) to enrich a knowledge base .
Following the success of the sequence - to - sequence architecture ( Bahdanau et al . , 2015 ) for generating sentences from structured data ( Marcheggiani and Perez - Beltrachini , 2018 ; Trisedya et al . , 2018 ) , we employ this architecture to do the opposite , which is extracting triples from a sentence .
In this paper , we study how to enrich a KB by relation exaction from textual sources .
Specifically , we aim to extract triples in the form of hh;r;ti , wherehis a head entity , tis a tail entity , andris a relationship between the entities .
Importantly , as KBs typically have much better coverage on entities than on relationships , we assume that handtare existing entities in a KB , ris a predicate that falls in a predeÔ¨Åned set of predicates we are interested in , but the relationshiphh;r;tidoes not exist in the KB yet .
We aim to Ô¨Ånd more relationships between handtand add them to the KB .
For example , from the Ô¨Årst extracted triples in Table 1 we may recognize two entities " NYU " ( abbreviation ofNew York University ) and " Private University " , which already exist in the KB ;
230also the predicate " instance of " is in the set of predeÔ¨Åned predicates we are interested in , but the relationship of hNYU , instance of , Private University idoes not exist in the KB .
We aim to add this relationship to our KB .
This is the typical situation for KB enrichment ( as opposed to constructing a KB from scratch or performing relation extraction for other purposes , such as Q&A or summarization ) .
KB enrichment mandates that the entities and relationships of the extracted triples are canonicalized by mapping them to their proper entity and predicate IDs in a KB .
Table 1 illustrates an example of triples extracted from a sentence .
The entities and predicate of the Ô¨Årst extracted triple , including NYU , instance of , and Private University , are mapped to their unique IDs Q49210 , P31 , and Q902104 , respectively , to comply with the semantic space of the KB .
Previous studies on relation extraction have employed both unsupervised and supervised approaches .
Unsupervised approaches typically start with a small set of manually deÔ¨Åned extraction patterns to detect entity names and phrases about relationships in an input text .
This paradigm is known as Open Information Extraction ( Open IE ) ( Banko et al . , 2007 ; Corro and Gemulla , 2013 ; Gashteovski et al . , 2017 ) .
In this line of approaches , both entities and predicates are captured in their surface forms without canonicalization .
Supervised approaches train statistical and neural models for inferring the relationship between two known entities in a sentence ( Mintz et al . , 2009 ; Riedel et al . , 2010 , 2013 ; Zeng et
al . , 2015 ; Lin et al . , 2016 ) .
Most of these studies employ a preprocessing step to recognize the entities .
Only few studies have fully integrated the mapping of extracted triples onto uniquely identiÔ¨Åed KB entities by using logical reasoning on the existing KB to disambiguate the extracted entities ( e.g. , ( Suchanek et al . , 2009 ;
Sa et al . , 2017 ) ) .
Most existing methods thus entail the need for Named Entity Disambiguation ( NED ) ( cf .
the survey by Shen et al . ( 2015 ) ) as a separate processing step .
In addition , the mapping of relationship phrases onto KB predicates necessitates another mapping step , typically aided by paraphrase dictionaries .
This two - stage architecture is inherently prone to error propagation across its two stages : NED errors may cause extraction errors ( and vice versa ) that lead to inaccurate relationships beingadded to the KB .
We aim to integrate the extraction and the canonicalization tasks by proposing an endto - end neural learning model to jointly extract triples from sentences and map them into an existing KB .
Our method is based on the encoder - decoder framework ( Cho et al . , 2014 ) by treating the task as a translation of a sentence into a sequence of elements of triples .
For the example in Table 1 , our model aims to translate " New York University is a private university in Manhattan " into a sequence of IDs " Q49210 P31 Q902104 Q49210 P131 Q11299 " , from which we can derive two triples to be added to the KB .
A standard encoder - decoder model with attention ( Bahdanau et al . , 2015 ) is , however , unable to capture the multi - word entity names and verbal or noun phrases that denote predicates .
To address this problem , we propose a novel form of n - gram based attention that computes the ngram combination of attention weight to capture the verbal or noun phrase context that complements the word level attention of the standard attention model .
Our model thus can better capture the multi - word context of entities and relationships .
Our model harnesses pre - trained word and entity embeddings that are jointly learned with skip gram ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) and TransE ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ) .
The advantages of our jointly learned embeddings are twofold .
First , the embeddings capture the relationship between words and entities , which is essential for named entity disambiguation .
Second , the entity embeddings preserve the relationships between entities , which help to build a highly accurate classiÔ¨Åer to Ô¨Ålter the invalid extracted triples .
To cope with the lack of fully labeled training data , we adapt distant supervision to generate aligned pairs of sentence and triple as the training data .
We augment the process with co - reference resolution ( Clark and Manning , 2016 ) and dictionary - based paraphrase detection ( Ganitkevitch et al . , 2013 ; Grycner and Weikum , 2016 ) .
The co - reference resolution helps extract sentences with implicit entity names , which enlarges the set of candidate sentences to be aligned with existing triples in a KB .
The paraphrase detection helps Ô¨Ålter sentences that do not express any relationships between entities .
The main contributions of this paper are : We propose an end - to - end model for extract-
231ing and canonicalizing triples to enrich a KB .
The model reduces error propagation between relation extraction and NED , which existing approaches are prone to .
We propose an n - gram based attention model to effectively map the multi - word mentions of entities and their relationships into uniquely identiÔ¨Åed entities and predicates .
We propose joint learning of word and entity embeddings to capture the relationship between words and entities for named entity disambiguation .
We further propose a modiÔ¨Åed beam search and a triple classiÔ¨Åer to generate high - quality triples .
We evaluate the proposed model over two real - world datasets .
We adapt distant supervision with co - reference resolution and paraphrase detection to obtain high - quality training data .
The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms a strong baseline for neural relation extraction ( Lin et al . , 2016 ) coupled with state - of - the - art NED models ( Hoffart et al . , 2011 ; Kolitsas et
al . , 2018 )
.
2 Related Work 2.1 Open Information Extraction Banko et al .
( 2007 ) introduced the paradigm of Open Information Extraction ( Open IE ) and proposed a pipeline that consists of three stages : learner , extractor , and assessor .
The learner uses dependency - parsing information to learn patterns for extraction , in an unsupervised way .
The extractor generates candidate triples by identifying noun phrases as arguments and connecting phrases as predicates .
The assessor assigns a probability to each candidate triple based on statistical evidence .
This approach was prone to extracting incorrect , verbose and uninformative triples .
Various followup studies ( Fader et al . , 2011 ; Mausam et al . , 2012 ; Angeli et al . , 2015 ; Mausam , 2016 ) improved the accuracy of Open IE , by adding handcrafted patterns or by using distant supervision .
Corro and Gemulla ( 2013 ) developed ClausIE , a method that analyzes the clauses in a sentence and derives triples from this structure .
Gashteovski et
al .
( 2017 ) developed MinIE to advance ClausIE by making the resulting triples more concise .
Stanovsky et
al .
( 2018 ) proposed a supervised learner for Open IE by casting relation extraction into sequence tagging .
A bi - LSTM model is trained to predict the label ( entity , predicate , or other ) of each token of the input .
The work mostrelated to ours is Neural Open IE ( Cui et
al . , 2018 ) , which proposed an encoder - decoder with attention model to extract triples .
However , this work is not geared for extracting relations of canonicalized entities .
Another line of studies use neural learning for semantic role labeling ( He et al . , 2018 ) , but the goal here is to recognize the predicate - argument structure of a single input sentence ‚Äì as opposed to extracting relations from a corpus .
All of these methods generate triples where the head and tail entities and the predicate stay in their surface forms .
Therefore , different names and phrases for the same entities result in multiple triples , which would pollute the KG if added this way .
The only means to map triples to uniquely identiÔ¨Åed entities in a KG is by post - processing via entity linking ( NED ) methods ( Shen et al . , 2015 ) or by clustering with subsequent mapping ( Gal¬¥arraga et al . , 2014 ) .
2.2 Entity - aware Relation Extraction Inspired by the work of Brin ( 1998 ) , state - of - theart methods employ distant supervision by leveraging seed facts from an existing KG ( Mintz et al . , 2009 ; Suchanek et al . , 2009 ; Carlson et al . , 2010 ) .
These methods learn extraction patterns from seed facts , apply the patterns to extract new fact candidates , iterate this principle , and Ô¨Ånally use statistical inference ( e.g. , a classiÔ¨Åer ) for reducing the false positive rate .
Some of these methods hinge on the assumption that the co - occurrence of a seed fact ‚Äôs entities in the same sentence is an indicator of expressing a semantic relationship between the entities .
This is a potential source of wrong labeling .
Follow - up studies ( Hoffmann et al . , 2010 ; Riedel et al . , 2010 , 2013 ; Surdeanu et al . , 2012 ) overcome this limitation by various means , including the use of relation - speciÔ¨Åc lexicons and latent factor models .
Still , these methods treat entities by their surface forms and disregard their mapping to existing entities in the KG .
Suchanek et al . ( 2009 ) and Sa et al .
( 2017 ) used probabilistic - logical inference to eliminate false positives , based on constraint solving or Monte Carlo sampling over probabilistic graphical models , respectively .
These methods integrate entity linking ( i.e. , NED ) into their models .
However , both have high computational complexity and rely on modeling constraints and appropriate priors .
Recent studies employ neural networks to learn the extraction of triples .

Lin et al .
( 2016 , 2017 ) improved this approach by proposing PCNN with sentence - level attention .
This method performed best in experimental studies ; hence we choose it as the main baseline against which we compare our approach .
Follow - up studies considered further variations :
Zhou et al .

( 2017 ) incorporated entity descriptions , Miwa and Bansal ( 2016 ) incorporated syntactic features , and Sorokin and Gurevych ( 2017 ) used background knowledge for contextualization .
None of these neural models is geared for KG enrichment , as the canonicalization of entities is out of their scope .
3 Proposed Model We start with the problem deÔ¨Ånition .
Let G= ( E;R)be an existing KG where EandRare the sets of entities and relationships ( predicates ) inG , respectively .
We consider a sentence
S = hw1;w2;:::;w iias the input , where wiis a token at positioniin the sentence .
We aim to extract a set of triples O = fo1;o2;:::;o jgfrom the sentence , where oj = hhj;rj;tji , hj;tj2E , and rj2R. Table 1 illustrates the input and target output of our problem .
3.1 Solution Framework Figure 1 illustrates the overall solution framework .
Our framework consists of three components : data collection module , embedding module , and neural relation extraction module .
In the data collection module ( detailed in Section 3.2 ) , we align known triples in an existing KB with sentences that contain such triples from a text corpus .
The aligned pairs of sentences and triples will later be used as the training data in our neural relation extraction module .
This alignment is done by distant supervision .
To obtain a large number of high - quality alignments , we augment the process with a co - reference resolution to extract sentences with implicit entity names , which enlarges the set of candidate sentences to be aligned .
We
233further use dictionary based paraphrase detection to Ô¨Ålter sentences that do not express any relationships between entities .
In the embedding module ( detailed in Section 3.3 ) , we propose a joint learning of word and entity embeddings by combining skip - gram ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) to compute the word embeddings and TransE ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ) to compute the entity embeddings .
The objective of the joint learning is to capture the similarity of words and entities that helps map the entity names into the related entity IDs .
Moreover , the resulting entity embeddings are used to train a triple classiÔ¨Åer that helps Ô¨Ålter invalid triples generated by our neural relation extraction model .
In the neural relation extraction module ( detailed in Section 3.4 ) , we propose an n - gram based attention model by expanding the attention mechanism to the n - gram token of a sentence .
The ngram attention computes the n - gram combination of attention weight to capture the verbal or noun phrase context that complements the word level attention of the standard attention model .
This expansion helps our model to better capture the multi - word context of entities and relationships .
The output of the encoder - decoder model is a sequence of the entity and predicate IDs where every three IDs indicate a triple .
To generate highquality triples , we propose two strategies .
The Ô¨Årst strategy uses a modiÔ¨Åed beam search that computes the lexical similarity of the extracted entities with the surface form of entity names in the input sentence to ensure the correct entity prediction .
The second strategy uses a triple classiÔ¨Åer that is trained using the entity embeddings from the joint learning to Ô¨Ålter the invalid triples .
The triple generation process is detailed in Section 3.5 3.2 Dataset Collection We aim to extract triples from a sentence for KB enrichment by proposing a supervised relation extraction model .
To train such a model , we need a large volume of fully labeled training data in the form of sentence - triple pairs .
Following Sorokin and Gurevych ( 2017 ) , we use distant supervision ( Mintz et al . , 2009 ) to align sentences in Wikipedia1with triples in Wikidata2(Vrandecic and Kr ¬®otzsch , 2014 ) .
1https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwikilatest-pages-articles.xml.bz2 2https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/latestall.ttl.gzWe map an entity mention in a sentence to the corresponding entity entry ( i.e. , Wikidata ID ) in Wikidata via the hyperlink associated to the entity mention , which is recorded in Wikidata as the url property of the entity entry .
Each pair may contain one sentence and multiple triples .
We sort the order of the triples based on the order of the predicate paraphrases that indicate the relationships between entities in the sentence .
We collect sentence - triple pairs by extracting sentences that contain both head and tail entities of Wikidata triples .
To generate high - quality sentence - triple pairs , we propose two additional steps : ( 1 ) extracting sentences that contain implicit entity names using co - reference resolution , and ( 2 ) Ô¨Åltering sentences that do not express any relationships using paraphrase detection .
We detail these steps below .
Prior to aligning the sentences with triples , in Step ( 1 ) , we Ô¨Ånd the implicit entity names to increase the number of candidate sentences to be aligned .
We apply co - reference resolution ( Clark and Manning , 2016 ) to each paragraph in a Wikipedia article and replace the extracted co - references with the proper entity name .
We observe that the Ô¨Årst sentence of a paragraph in a Wikipedia article may contain a pronoun that refers to the main entity .
For example , there is a paragraph in the Barack Obama article that starts with a sentence " He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998 " .
This may cause the standard co - reference resolution to miss the implicit entity names for the rest of the paragraph .
To address this problem , we heuristically replace the pronouns in the Ô¨Årst sentence of a paragraph if the main entity name of the Wikipedia page is not mentioned .
For the sentence in the previous example , we replace " He " with"Barack Obama " .
The intuition is that a Wikipedia article contains content of a single entity of interest , and that the pronouns mentioned in the Ô¨Årst sentence of a paragraph mostly relate to the main entity .
In Step ( 2 ) , we use a dictionary based paraphrase detection to capture relationships between entities in a sentence .
First , we create a dictionary by populating predicate paraphrases from three sources including PATTY ( Nakashole et al . , 2012 ) , POLY ( Grycner and Weikum , 2016 ) , and PPDB ( Ganitkevitch et al . , 2013 ) that yield 540 predicates and 24;013 unique paraphrases .
For example , predicate paraphrases for the relation-
234#pairs # triples # entities # predicates All ( WIKI )
255,654 330,005 279,888 158 Train+val 225,869 291,352 249,272 157 Test ( WIKI ) 29,785 38,653 38,690 109 Test ( GEO ) 1,000 1,095 124 11 Table 2 : Statistics of the dataset .
ship " place of birth " arefborn in , was born in , ...
g. Then , we use this dictionary to Ô¨Ålter sentences that do not express any relationships between entities .
We use exact string matching to Ô¨Ånd verbal or noun phrases in a sentence which is a paraphrases of a predicate of a triple .
For example , for the triple hBarack Obama , place of birth , Honolulu i , the sentence " Barack Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu , Hawaii " will be retained while the sentence " Barack Obama visited Honolulu in 2010 " will be removed ( the sentence may be retained if there is another valid triple hBarack Obama , visited , Honolulu i ) .
This helps Ô¨Ålter noises for the sentence - triple alignment .
The collected dataset contains 255,654 sentence - triple pairs .
For each pair , the maximum number of triples is four ( i.e. , a sentence can produce at most four triples ) .
We split the dataset into train set ( 80 % ) , dev set ( 10 % ) and test set ( 10 % ) ( we call it the WIKI test dataset ) .
For stress testing ( to test the proposed model on a different style of text than the training data ) , we also collect another test dataset outside Wikipedia .
We apply the same procedure to the user reviews of a travel website .
First , we collect user reviews on 100 popular landmarks in Australia .
Then , we apply the adapted distant supervision to the reviews and collect 1,000 sentence - triple pairs ( we call it the GEO test dataset ) .
Table 2 summarizes the statistics of our datasets .
3.3 Joint Learning of Word and Entity Embeddings Our relation extraction model is based on the encoder - decoder framework which has been widely used in Neural Machine Translation to translate text from one language to another .
In our setup , we aim to translate a sentence into triples , and hence the vocabulary of the source input is a set of English words while the vocabulary of the target output is a set of entity and predicate IDs in an existing KG .
To compute the embeddings of the source and target vocabularies , we proposea joint learning of word and entity embeddings that is effective to capture the similarity between words and entities for named entity disambiguation ( Yamada et al . , 2016 ) .
Note that our method differs from that of Yamada et al .
( 2016 )
.
We use joint learning by combining skip - gram ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) to compute the word embeddings and TransE ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ) to compute the entity embeddings ( including the relationship embeddings ) , while Yamada et al .
( 2016 ) use Wikipedia Link - based Measure ( WLM ) ( Milne and Witten , 2008 ) that does not consider the relationship embeddings .
Our model learns the entity embeddings by minimizing a margin - based objective function JE :
JE = X tr2TrX t0r2T0rmax  0;  + f(tr) f(t0 r) ( 1 ) Tr = fhh;r;tijhh;r;ti2Gg ( 2 ) Tr0= h0;r;t   jh02E 	  [  h;r;t0   jt02E 	  ( 3 ) f(tr ) = kh+r tk ( 4 ) Here , kxkis the L1 - Norm of vector x ,  is a margin hyperparameter , Tris the set of valid relationship triples from a KG G , andT0 ris the set of corrupted relationship triples ( recall that Eis the set of entities in G ) .
The corrupted triples are used as negative samples , which are created by replacing the head or tail entity of a valid triple in Tr with a random entity .
We use all triples in Wikidata except those which belong to the testing data to compute the entity embeddings .
To establish the interaction between the entity and word embeddings , we follow the Anchor Context Model proposed by Yamada et al .
( 2016 )
.
First , we generate a text corpus by combining the original text and the modiÔ¨Åed anchor text of Wikipedia .
This is done by replacing the entity names in a sentence with the related entity or predicate IDs .
For example , the sentence " New York University is a private university in Manhattan " is modiÔ¨Åed into " Q49210 is a Q902104 in Q11299 " .
Then , we use the skip - gram method to compute the word embeddings from the generated corpus ( the entity IDs in the modiÔ¨Åed anchor text are treated as words in the skip - gram model ) .
Given a sequence of nwords [ w1;w2;:::;w n ] , The model learns the word embeddings , by minimizing the following objective function JW : JW=1 TnX t=1X  cjc;j6=0logP(wt+jjwt)(5 )
235P(wt+jjwt )
= exp(v0 wt+j > vwt ) PW i=1(v0
i > vwt)(6 )
wherecis the size of the context window , wt denotes the target word , and wt+jis the context word ; vwandv0 ware the input and output vector representations of word w , andWis the vocabulary size .
The overall objective function of the joint learning of word and entity embeddings is : J = JE+JW ( 7 ) 3.4 N - gram Based Attention Model Our proposed relation extraction model integrates the extraction and canonicalization tasks for KB enrichment in an end - to - end manner .
To build such a model , we employ an encoder - decoder model ( Cho et al . , 2014 ) to translate a sentence into a sequence of triples .
The encoder encodes a sentence into a vector that is used by the decoder as a context to generate a sequence of triples .
Because we treat the input and output as a sequence , We use the LSTM networks ( Hochreiter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ) in the encoder and the decoder .
The encoder - decoder with attention model ( Bahdanau et al . , 2015 ) has been used in machine translation .
However , in the relation extraction task , the attention model can not capture the multiword entity names .
In our preliminary investigation , we found that the attention model yields misalignment between the word and the entity .
The above problem is due to the same words in the names of different entities ( e.g. , the word University in different university names such asNew York University , Washington University , etc . ) .
During training , the model pays more attention to the word University to differentiate different types of entities of a similar name , e.g. , New York University , New York Times Building , or New York Life Building , but not the same types of entities of different names ( e.g. , New York University and Washington University ) .
This may cause errors in entity alignment , especially when predicting the ID of an entity that is not in the training data .
Even though we addhEntity - name , Entity - ID i pairs as training data ( see the Training section ) , the misalignments still take place .
We address the above problem by proposing an n - gram based attention model .
This model computes the attention of all possible n - grams of the sentence input .
The attention weights are computed over the n - gram combinations of the word embeddings , and hence the context vector for the decoder is computed as follows .
cd t=2 4he;jNjX n=1Wn0 @jXnjX i=1  n ixn i1 A3 5 ( 8)  n i =
exp(he > Vnxn i ) PjXnj j=1exp(he > Vnxn j)(9 )
Here , cd tis the context vector of the decoder at timestept , heis the last hidden state of the encoder , the superscript nindicates the n - gram combination , xis the word embeddings of input sentence , jXnjis the total number of n - gram token combination , Nindicates the maximum value of nused in the n - gram combinations ( N= 3 in our experiments ) , WandVare learned parameter matrices , and  is the attention weight .
Training In the training phase , in addition to the sentencetriple pairs collected using distant supervision ( see Section 3.2 ) , we also add pairs of hEntity - name , Entity - ID iof all entities in the KB to the training data , e.g. , hNew York University , Q49210 i.
This allows the model to learn the mapping between entity names and entity IDs , especially for the unseen entities .
3.5 Triple Generation The output of the encoder - decoder model is a sequence of the entity and predicate IDs where every three tokens indicate a triple .
Therefore , to extract a triple , we simply group every three tokens of the generated output .
However , the greedy approach ( i.e. , picking the entity with the highest probability of the last softmax layer of the decoder ) may lead the model to extract incorrect entities due to the similarity between entity embeddings ( e.g. , the embeddings of New York City andChicago may be similar because both are cities in USA ) .
To address this problem , we propose two strategies : re - ranking the predicted entities using a modiÔ¨Åed beam search and Ô¨Åltering invalid triples using a triple classiÔ¨Åer .
The modiÔ¨Åed beam search re - ranks top - k ( k= 10 in our experiments ) entity IDs that are predicted

by the decoder by computing the edit distance between the entity names ( obtained from the KB ) and every n - gram token of the input sentence .
The intuition is that the entity name should be mentioned in the sentence so that the entity with the highest similarity will be chosen as the output .
Our triple classiÔ¨Åer is trained with entity embeddings from the joint learning ( see Section 3.3 ) .
Triple classiÔ¨Åcation is one of the metrics to evaluate the quality of entity embeddings ( Socher et al . , 2013 ) .
We build a classiÔ¨Åer to determine the validity of a triplehh;r;ti .
We train a binary classiÔ¨Åer based on the plausibility score ( h+r t)(the score to compute the entity embeddings ) .
We create negative samples by corrupting the valid triples ( i.e. , replacing the head or tail entity by a random entity ) .
The triple classiÔ¨Åer is effective to Ô¨Ålter invalid triple such as hNew York University , capital of , Manhattan i. 4 Experiments We evaluate our model on two real datasets including WIKI and GEO test datasets ( see Section 3.2 ) .
We use precision , recall , and F1 score as the evaluation metrics .
4.1 Hyperparameters We use grid search to Ô¨Ånd the best hyperparameters for the networks .
We use 512 hidden units for both the encoder and the decoder .
We use 64 dimensions of pre - trained word and entity embeddings ( see Section 3.3 ) .
We use a 0.5 dropout rate for regularization on both the encoder and the decoder .
We use Adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2015)with a learning rate of 0.0002 .
4.2 Models We compare our proposed model3with three existing models including CNN ( the state - of - theart supervised approach by Lin et al .
( 2016 ) ) , MiniE ( the state - of - the - art unsupervised approach by Gashteovski et al . ( 2017 ) ) , and ClausIE by Corro and Gemulla ( 2013 ) .
To map the extracted entities by these models , we use two state - of - theart NED systems including AIDA ( Hoffart et al . , 2011 ) and NeuralEL ( Kolitsas et al . , 2018 ) .
The precision ( tested on our test dataset ) of AIDA and NeuralEL are 70 % and61 % respectively .
To map the extracted predicates ( relationships ) of the unsupervised approaches output , we use the dictionary based paraphrase detection .
We use the same dictionary that is used to collect the dataset ( i.e. , the combination of three paraphrase dictionaries including PATTY ( Nakashole et al . , 2012 ) , POLY ( Grycner and Weikum , 2016 ) , and PPDB ( Ganitkevitch et al . , 2013 ) ) .
We replace the extracted predicate with the correct predicate ID if one of the paraphrases of the correct predicate ( i.e. , the gold standard ) appear in the extracted predicate .
Otherwise , we replace the extracted predicate with " NA " to indicate an unrecognized predicate .
We also compare our N - gram Attention model with two encoder - decoder based models including the Single Attention model ( Bahdanau et al . , 2015 )
andTransformer model ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) .
3The code and the dataset are made available at http://www.ruizhang.info/GKB/gkb.htm
2374.3 Results Table 3 shows that the end - to - end models outperform the existing model .
In particular , our proposed n - gram attention model achieves the best results in terms of precision , recall , and F1 score .
Our proposed model outperforms the best existing model ( MinIE ) by 33:39 % and34:78 % in terms of F1 score on the WIKI and GEO test dataset respectively .
These results are expected since the existing models are affected by the error propagation of the NED .
As expected , the combination of the existing models with AIDA achieves higher F1 scores than the combination with NeuralEL as AIDA achieves a higher precision than NeuralEL .
To further show the effect of error propagation , we set up an experiment without the canonicalization task ( i.e. , the objective is predicting a relationship between known entities ) .
We remove the NED pre - processing step by allowing the CNN model to access the correct entities .
Meanwhile , we provide the correct entities to the decoder of our proposed model .
In this setup , our proposed model achieves 86:34 % and79:11 % , while CNN achieves 81:92 % and75:82 % in precision over the WIKI and GEO test datasets , respectively .
Our proposed n - gram attention model outperforms the end - to - end models by 15:51 % and 8:38 % in terms of F1 score on the WIKI and GEO test datasets , respectively .
The Transformer model also only yields similar performance to that of the Single Attention model , which is worse than ours .
These results indicate that our model captures multi - word entity name ( in both datasets , 82:9%of
the entities have multi - word entity name ) in the input sentence better than the other models .
Table 3 also shows that the pre - trained embeddings improve the performance of the model in all measures .
Moreover , the pre - trained embeddings help the model to converge faster .
In our experiments , the models that use the pre - trained embeddings converge in 20epochs on average , while the models that do not use the pre - trained embeddings converge in 30 40epochs .
Our triple classiÔ¨Åer combined with the modiÔ¨Åed beam search boost the performance of the model .
The modiÔ¨Åed beam search provides a high recall by extracting the correct entities based on the surface form in the input sentence while the triple classiÔ¨Åer provides a high precision by Ô¨Åltering the invalid triples .
Discussion We further perform manual error analysis .
We found that the incorrect output of our model is caused by the same entity name of two different entities ( e.g. , the name of Michael Jordan that refers to the American basketball player or the English footballer ) .
The modiÔ¨Åed beam search can not disambiguate those entities as it only considers the lexical similarity .
We consider using context - based similarity as future work .
5 Conclusions We proposed an end - to - end relation extraction model for KB enrichment that integrates the extraction and canonicalization tasks .
Our model thus reduces the error propagation between relation extraction and NED that existing approaches are prone to .
To obtain high - quality training data , we adapt distant supervision and augment it with co - reference resolution and paraphrase detection .
We propose an n - gram based attention model that better captures the multi - word entity names in a sentence .
Moreover , we propose a modiÔ¨Åed beam search and a triple classiÔ¨Åcation that helps the model to generate high - quality triples .
Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the existing models by 33:39 % and34:78 % in terms of F1 score on the WIKI and GEO test dataset respectively .
These results conÔ¨Årm that our model reduces the error propagation between NED and relation extraction .
Our proposed n - gram attention model outperforms the other encoder - decoder models by 15:51 % and 8:38 % in terms of F1 score on the two real - world datasets .
These results conÔ¨Årm that our model better captures the multi - word entity names in a sentence .
In the future , we plan to explore contextbased similarity to complement the lexical similarity to improve the overall performance .
