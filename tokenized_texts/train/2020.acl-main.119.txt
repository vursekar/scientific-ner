Abstract We propose a new end - to - end model that treats AMR parsing as a series of dual decisions on the input sequence and the incrementally constructed graph .
At each time step , our model performs multiple rounds of attention , reasoning , and composition that aim to answer two critical questions : ( 1 ) which part of the input sequence to abstract ; and ( 2 ) where in the outputgraph to construct the new concept .
We show that the answers to these two questions are mutually causalities .
We design a model based on iterative inference that helps achieve better answers in both perspectives , leading to greatly improved parsing accuracy .
Our experimental results signiﬁcantly outperform all previously reported S MATCH scores by large margins .
Remarkably , without the help of any large - scale pre - trained language model ( e.g. , BERT ) , our model already surpasses previous state - of - the - art using BERT .
With the help of BERT , we can push the state - of - the - art results to 80.2 % on LDC2017T10 ( AMR 2.0 ) and 75.4 % on LDC2014T12 ( AMR 1.0 ) .
1 Introduction Abstract Meaning Representation ( AMR ) ( Banarescu et al . , 2013 ) is a broad - coverage semantic formalism that encodes the meaning of a sentence as a rooted , directed , and labeled graph , where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relations ( See an example in Figure 1 ) .
AMR parsing is the task of transforming natural language text into AMR .
One biggest challenge of AMR parsing is the lack of explicit alignments between nodes ( concepts ) in the graph and words in the text .
This characteristic not only poses great difﬁculty in concept The work described in this paper is substantially supported by grants from the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region , China ( Project Code : 14204418 ) and the Direct Grant of the Faculty of Engineering , CUHK ( Project Code : 4055093).prediction but also brings a close tie for concept prediction and relation prediction .
While most previous works rely on a pre - trained aligner to train a parser , some recent attempts include : modeling the alignments as latent variables ( Lyu and Titov , 2018 ) , attention - based sequenceto - sequence transduction models ( Barzdins and Gosko , 2016 ;
Konstas et al . , 2017 ; van Noord and Bos , 2017 ) , and attention - based sequence - to - graph transduction models ( Cai and Lam , 2019 ; Zhang et al . , 2019b ) .
Sequence - to - graph transduction models build a semantic graph incrementally via spanning one node at every step .
This property is appealing in terms of both computational efﬁciency and cognitive modeling since it mimics what human experts usually do , i.e. , ﬁrst grasping the core ideas then digging into more details ( Banarescu et al . , 2013 ; Cai and Lam , 2019 ) .
Unfortunately , the parsing accuracy of existing works including recent state - of - the - arts ( Zhang et al . , 2019a , b ) remain unsatisfactory compared to human - level performance,1especially in cases where the sentences are rather long and informative , which indicates substantial room for improvement .
One possible reason for the deﬁciency is the inherent defect of one - pass prediction process ; that is , the lack of the modeling capability of the interactions between concept prediction and relation prediction , which is critical to achieving fullyinformed and unambiguous decisions .
We introduce a new approach tackling AMR parsing , following the incremental sequence - tograph transduction paradigm .
We explicitly characterize each spanning step as the efforts for ﬁnding which part to abstract with respect to the input sequence , and where to construct with respect to the partially constructed output graph .
Equivalently , 1The average annotator vs. inter - annotator agreement ( SMATCH ) was 0.83 for newswire and 0.79 for web text according to Banarescu et al . ( 2013 ) .
1291we treat AMR parsing as a series of dual decisions on the input sequence and the incrementally constructed graph .
Intuitively , the answer of what concept to abstract decides where to construct ( i.e. , the relations to existing concepts ) , while the answer of where to construct determines what concept to abstract .
Our proposed model , supported by neural networks with explicit structure for attention , reasoning , and composition , integrated with an iterative inference algorithm .
It iterates between ﬁnding supporting text pieces and reading the partially constructed semantic graph , inferring more accurate and harmonious expansion decisions progressively .
Our model is aligner - free and can be effectively trained with limited amount of labeled data .
Experiments on two AMR benchmarks demonstrate that our parser outperforms the previous best parsers on both benchmarks .
It achieves the best - reported SMATCH scores ( F1 ): 80.2 % on LDC2017T10 and 75.4 % on LDC2014T12 , surpassing the previous state - of - the - art models by large margins .
2 Related Work & Background On a coarse - grained level , we can categorize existing AMR parsing approaches into two main classes : Two - stage parsing ( Flanigan et al . , 2014 ; Lyu and Titov , 2018 ; Zhang et al . , 2019a ) uses a pipeline design for concept identiﬁcation and relation prediction , where the concept decisions precede all relation decisions ; One - stage parsing constructs a parse graph incrementally .
For more ﬁne - grained analysis , those one - stage parsing methods can be further categorized into three types : Transitionbased parsing ( Wang et al . , 2016 ;
Damonte et al . , 2017 ; Ballesteros and Al - Onaizan , 2017 ; Peng et al . , 2017 ; Guo and Lu , 2018 ; Liu et al . , 2018 ; Wang and Xue , 2017 ; Naseem et al . , 2019 ) processes a sentence from left - to - right and constructs the graph incrementally by alternately inserting a new node or building a new edge .
Seq2seq - based parsing ( Barzdins and Gosko , 2016 ; Konstas et al . , 2017 ; van Noord and Bos , 2017 ; Peng et
al . , 2018 ) views parsing as sequence - to - sequence transduction by some linearization of the AMR graph .
The concept and relation prediction are then treated equally with a shared vocabulary .
The third class is graph - based parsing ( Cai and Lam , 2019 ; Zhang et
al . , 2019b ) , where at each time step , a new node along with its connections to existing nodes are jointly decided , either in order ( Cai and Lam , 2019 ) or in parallel ( Zhang et al . , 2019b ) .

3 Motivation Our approach is inspired by the deliberation process when a human expert is deducing a semantic graph from a sentence .
The output graph starts from an empty graph and spans incrementally in a node - by - node manner .
At any time step of this process , we are distilling the information for the next expansion .
We call it expansion because the new node , as an abstract concept of some speciﬁc text fragments in the input sentence , is derived to complete some missing elements in the current semantic graph .
Speciﬁcally , given the input sentence and the current partially constructed graph , we are answering two critical questions : which part of the input sequence to abstract , and where in the output graph to construct the new concept .
For instance , Figure 1(a ) and ( b ) show two possible choices for the next expansion .
In Figure 1(a ) , the word “ boy ” is abstracted to the concept boy to complement the subject information of the event go-02 .
On the

The details of fandgare shown in red and blue boxes , where nodes in graph and tokens in sequence are selected via attention mechanisms .
other hand , in Figure 1(b ) , a polarity attribute of the event go-2 is constructed , which is triggered by the word “ not ” in the sentence .
We note that the answer to one of the questions can help answer the other .
For instance , if we have decided to render the word “ not ” to the graph , then we will consider adding an edge labeled as polarity , and ﬁnally determine its attachment to the existing event go-2 ( rather than an edge labeled ARG0 to the same event go-2 , though it is also present in the golden graph ) .
On the other hand , if we have decided to ﬁnd the subject ( ARG0 relation ) of the action go-02 , we are conﬁdent to locate the word “ boy ” instead of function words like “ not ” or “ must ” , thus unambiguously predict the right concept boy .
Another possible circumstance is that we may make a mistake trying to ask something that is not present in the sentence ( e.g. , the destination of the go-02 action ) .
This attempt will be rejected by a review of the sentence .
The rationale is that literally we can not ﬁnd the destination information in the sentence .
Similarly , if we mistakenly propose to abstract some parts of the sentence that are not ready for construction yet , the proposal will be rejected by another inspection on the graph since that there is nowhere to place such a new concept .
We believe the mutual causalities , as described above , are useful for action disambiguation and harmonious decision making , which eventually result in more accurate parses .
We formulate AMR parsing as a series of dual graph - sequence decisions and design an iterative inference approachto tackle each of them .
It is sort of analogous to the cognition procedure of a person , who might ﬁrst notice part of the important information in one side ( graph or sequence ) , then try to conﬁrm her decision at the other side , which could just refute her former hypothesis and propose a new one , and ﬁnally converge to a conclusion after multiple rounds of reasoning .
4 Proposed Model 4.1 Overview Formally , the parsing model consists of a series of graph expansion procedures fG0!:::!Gi ! : : : g , starting from an empty graph G0 .
In each turn of expansion , the following iterative inference process is performed : yi t = g(Gi;xi t ) ; xi t+1 = f(W;yi t ) ; whereW;Giare the input sequence and the current semantic graph respectively .
g();f()seek where to construct ( edge prediction ) and what to abstract ( node prediction ) respectively , and xi t;yi tare the t - th graph hypothesis ( where to construct ) and t - th sequence hypothesis ( what to abstract ) for the i - th expansion step respectively .
For clarity , we may drop the superscript iin the following descriptions .
Figure 2 depicts an overview of the graphsequence iterative inference process .
Our model has four main components : ( 1 ) Sequence Encoder , which generates a set of text memories ( per token )
1293to provide grounding for concept alignment and abstraction ; ( 2 ) Graph Encoder , which generates a set of graph memories ( per node ) to provide grounding for relation reasoning ; ( 3 ) Concept Solver , where a previous graph hypothesis is used for concept prediction ; and ( 4 ) Graph Solver , where a previous concept hypothesis is used for relation prediction .
The last two components correspond to the reasoning functions g()andf()respectively .
The text memories can be computed by Sentence Encoder at the beginning of the whole parsing while the graph memories are constructed by Graph Encoder incrementally as the parsing progresses .
During the iterative inference , a semantic representation of current state is used to attend to both graph and text memories ( blue and red arrows ) in order to locate the new concept and obtain its relations to the existing graph , both of which subsequently reﬁne each other .
Intuitively , after a ﬁrst glimpse of the input sentence and the current graph , speciﬁc sub - areas of both sequence and graph are revisited to obtain a better understanding of the current situation .
Later steps typically read the text in detail with speciﬁc learning aims , either conﬁrming or overturning a previous hypothesis .
Finally , after several iterations of reasoning steps , the reﬁned sequence / graph decisions are used for graph expansion .
4.2 Sequence Encoder As mentioned above , we employ a sequence encoder to convert the input sentence into vector representations .
The sequence encoder follows the multi - layer Transformer architecture described in Vaswani et
al . ( 2017 ) .
At the bottom layer , each token is ﬁrstly transformed into the concatenation of features learned by a character - level convolutional neural network ( charCNN , Kim et
al . , 2016 ) and randomly initialized embeddings for its lemma , part - of - speech tag , and named entity tag .
Additionally , we also include features learned by pre - trained language model BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019).2
Formally , for an input sequence w1;w2;:::;w n with lengthn , we insert a special token BOS at the beginning of the sequence .
For clarity , we omit the detailed transformations ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) and denote the ﬁnal output from our sequence encoder asfh0;h1;:::;h ng2Rd , whereh0corresponds the special token BOS and serves as an overall rep2We obtain word - level representations from pre - trained BERT in the same way as Zhang et al .
( 2019a , b ) , where subtoken representations at the last layer are averaged.resentation while others are considered as contextualized word representations .
Note that the sequence encoder only needs to be invoked once , and the produced text memories are used for the whole parsing procedure .
4.3 Graph Encoder We use a similar idea in Cai and Lam ( 2019 ) to encode the incrementally expanding graph .
Specifically , a graph is simply treated as a sequence of nodes ( concepts ) in the chronological order of when they are inserted into the graph .
We employ multi - layer Transformer architecture with masked self - attention and source - attention , which only allows each position in the node sequence to attend to all positions up to and including that position , and every position in the node sequence to attend over all positions in the input sequence.3While this design allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization during training and computation - saving incrementality during testing,4it inherently neglects the edge information .
We attempted to alleviate this problem by incorporating the idea of Strubell et al .
( 2018 ) that applies auxiliary supervision at attention heads to encourage them to attend to each node ’s parents in the AMR graph .
However , we did not see performance improvement .
We attribute the failure to the fact that the neural attention mechanisms on their own are already capable of learning to attend to useful graph elements , and the auxiliary supervision is likely to disturb the ultimate parsing goal .
Consequently , for the current graph Gwith mnodes , we take its output concept sequence c1;c2;:::;c mas input .
Similar to the sequence encoder , we insert a special token BOG at the beginning of the concept sequence .
Each concept is ﬁrstly transformed into the concatenation of feature vector learned by a char - CNN and randomly initialized embedding .
Then , a multi - layer Transformer encoder with masked self - attention and sourceattention is applied , resulting in vector representationsfs0;s1;:::;s mg2Rd , wheres0represents the special concept BOG and serves as a dummy node while others are considered as contextualized node representations .
3It is analogous to a standard Transformer decoder ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) for sequence - to - sequence learning .
4Trivially employing a graph neural network here can be computationally expensive and intractable since it needs to re - compute all graph representations after every expansion .
12944.4 Concept Solver At each sequence reasoning step t , the concept solver receives a state vector ytthat carries the latest graph decision and the input sequence memoriesh1;:::;h nfrom the sequence encoder , and aims to locate the proper parts in the input sequence to abstract and generate a new concept .
We employ the scaled dot - product attention proposed in Vaswani et
al .
( 2017 ) to solve this problem .
Concretely , we ﬁrst calculate an attention distribution over all input tokens :  t = softmax ( ( WQyt)TWKh1 : npdk ) ; wherefWQ;WKg2Rdkddenote learnable linear projections that transform the input vectors into the query and key subspace respectively , and dk represents the dimensionality of the subspace .
The attention weights  t2Rnprovide a soft alignment between the new concept and the tokens in the input sequence .
We then compute the probability distribution of the new concept label through a hybrid of three channels .
First ,  tis fed through an MLP and softmax to obtain a probability distribution over a pre - deﬁned vocabulary : MLP (  t ) = ( WVh1 : n )  t+yt ( 1 ) P(vocab)=softmax
( W(vocab)MLP (  t ) + b(vocab ) ) ; whereWV2Rdddenotes the learnable linear projection that transforms the text memories into the value subspace , and the value vectors are averaged according to  tfor concept label prediction .
Second , the attention weights  tdirectly serve as a copy mechanism ( Gu et al . , 2016 ; See et al . , 2017 ) , i , e. , the probabilities of copying a token lemma from the input text as a node label .
Third , to address the attribute values such as person names or numerical strings , we also use  tfor another copy mechanism that directly copies the original strings of input tokens .
The above three channels are combined via a soft switch to control the production of the concept label from different sources :
[ p0;p1;p2 ] = softmax ( W(switch)MLP (  t ) ) ; where MLP is the same as in Eq . 1 , and p0;p1and p2are the probabilities of three prediction channels respectively .
Hence , the ﬁnal prediction probabilityof a concept cis given by : P(c ) = p0P(vocab)(c ) + p1(X i2L(c )  t[i ] )
+ p2(X i2T(c )  t[i ] ) ; where [ i]indexes the i - th element and L(c)and T(c)are index sets of lemmas and tokens respectively that have the surface form as c. 4.5 Relation Solver At each graph reasoning step t , the relation solver receives a state vector xtthat carries the latest concept decision and the output graph memories s0;s1;:::;s mfrom the graph encoder , and aims to point out the nodes in the current graph that have an immediate relation to the new concept ( source nodes ) and generate corresponding edges .
Similar to Cai and Lam ( 2019 ) ; Zhang et al . ( 2019b ) , we factorize the task as two stages : First , a relation identiﬁcation module points to some preceding nodes as source nodes ; Then , the relation classiﬁcation module predicts the relation type between the new concept and predicted source nodes .
We leave the latter to be determined after iterative inference .
AMR is a rooted , directed , and acyclic graph .
The reason for AMR being a graph instead of a tree is that it allows reentrancies where a concept participates in multiple semantic relations with different semantic roles .
Following Cai and Lam ( 2019 ) , we use multi - head attention for a more compact parsing procedure where multiple source nodes are simultaneously determined.5Formally , our relation identiﬁcation module employs Hdifferent attention heads , for each head h , we calculate an attention distribution over all existing node ( including the dummy node s0 ):  h t = softmax ( ( WQ hxt)TWK hs0 : mpdk ): Then , we take the maximum over different heads as the ﬁnal edge probabilities :  t[i ]
= Hmax h=1  h t[i ] : Therefore , different heads may points to different nodes at the same time .
Intuitively , each head represents a distinct relation detector for a particular 5This is different to Zhang
et al .
( 2019b ) where an AMR graph is converted into a tree by duplicating nodes that have reentrant relations .

set of relation types .
For each attention head , it will point to a source node if certain relations exist between the new node and the existing graph , otherwise it will point to the dummy node .
An example with four attention heads and three existing nodes ( excluding the dummy node ) is illustrated in Figure 3 . 4.6 Iterative Inference As described above , the concept solver and the relation solver are conceptually two attention mechanisms over the sequence and graph respectively , addressing the concept prediction and relation prediction separately .
The key is to pass the decisions between the solvers so that they can examine each other ’s answer and make harmonious decisions .
Speciﬁcally , at each spanning step i , we start the iterative inference by setting x0 = h0and solving f(Gi;x0 ) .
After thet - th graph reasoning , we compute the state vector yt , which will be handed over to the concept solver as g(W;y t ) , as : yt = FFN(y)(xt+ ( WVh1 : n )  t ) ; where FFN(y)is a feed - forward network and WV projects text memories into a value space .
Similarly , after the t - th sequence reasoning , we update the state vector from yttoxt+1as : xt+1 = FFN(x)(yt+HX h=1(WV hs0 : n )  h t ) ; where FFN(x)is a feed - forward network and WV h projects graph memories into a value space for each headh .

Otherwise , the whole parsing process is terminated and the current graph is returned as ﬁnal result .
The complete parsing process adopting the iterative inference is described in Algorithm 1 . 5 Training & Prediction Our model is trained with the standard maximum likelihood estimate .
The optimization objective is to maximize the sum of the decomposed step - wise log - likelihood , where each is the sum of concept , edge , and edge label probabilities .
To facilitate training , we create a reference generation order of nodes by running a breadth-ﬁrst - traversal over target AMR graphs , as it is cognitively appealing ( core - semantic-ﬁrst principle , Cai and Lam , 2019 ) and the effectiveness of pre - order traversal is also
1296empirically veriﬁed by Zhang et al . ( 2019a ) in a depth-ﬁrst setting .
For the generation order for sibling nodes , we adopt the uniformly random order and the deterministic order sorted by the relation frequency in a 1 : 1 ratio at ﬁrst then change to the deterministic order only in the ﬁnal training steps .
We empirically ﬁnd that the deterministic - afterrandom strategy slightly improves performance .
During testing , our model searches for the best output graph through beam search based on the log - likelihood at each spanning step .
The time complexity of our model is O(kjVj ) , wherekis the beam size , and jVjis the number of nodes .
6 Experiments 6.1 Experimental Setup Datasets Our evaluation is conducted on two AMR public releases : AMR 2.0 ( LDC0217T10 ) and AMR 1.0 ( LDC2014T12 ) .
AMR 2.0 is the latest and largest AMR sembank that was extensively used in recent works .
AMR 1.0 shares the same development and test set with AMR , while the size of its training set is only about one - third of AMR 2.0 , making it a good testbed to evaluate our model ’s sensitivity for data size.6 Implementation Details We use Stanford CoreNLP ( Manning et al . , 2014 ) for tokenization , lemmatization , part - of - speech , and named entity tagging .
The hyper - parameters of our models are chosen on the development set of AMR 2.0 .
Without explicit speciﬁcation , we perform N= 4 steps of iterative inference .
Other hyper - parameter settings can be found in the Appendix .
Our models are trained using ADAM ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) for up to 60 K steps ( ﬁrst 50 K with the random sibling order and last 10 K with deterministic order ) , with early stopping based on development set performance .
We ﬁx BERT parameters similar to Zhang et al .
( 2019a , b ) due to the GPU memory limit .
During testing , we use a beam size of 8 for the highest - scored graph approximation.7 AMR Pre- and Post - processing We remove senses as done in Lyu and Titov ( 2018 ) ; Zhang et al .
( 2019a , b ) and simply assign the most frequent sense for nodes in post - processing .
Notably , 6There are a few annotation revisions from AMR 1.0 to AMR 2.0 .
7Our code is released at https://github.com/ jcyk / AMR - gs .most existing methods including the state - the - ofart parsers ( Zhang et al . , 2019a , b ; Lyu and Titov , 2018 ; Guo and Lu , 2018 , inter alia ) often rely on heavy graph re - categorization for reducing the complexity and sparsity of the original AMR graphs .
For graph re - categorization , speciﬁc subgraphs of AMR are grouped together and assigned to a single node with a new compound category , which usually involves non - trivial expert - level manual efforts for hand - crafting rules .
We follow the exactly same pre- and post - processing steps of those of Zhang et al .
( 2019a , b ) for graph re - categorization .
More details can be found in the Appendix .
Ablated Models As pointed out by Cai and Lam ( 2019 ) , the precise set of graph re - categorization rules differs among different works , making it difﬁcult to distinguish the performance improvement from model optimization and carefully designed rules .
In addition , only recent works ( Zhang et al . , 2019a , b ; Lindemann et al . , 2019 ; Naseem et al . , 2019 ) have started to utilize the large - scale pretrained language model , BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ; Wolf et al . , 2019 ) .
Therefore , we also include ablated models for addressing two questions : ( 1 ) How dependent is our model on performance from handcrafted graph re - categorization rules ?
( 2 ) How much does BERT help ?
We accordingly implement three ablated models by removing either one of them or removing both .
The ablation study not only reveals the individual effect of two model components but also helps facilitate fair comparisons with prior works .
6.2 Experimental Results Main Results The performance of AMR parsing is conventionally evaluated by SMATCH ( F1 ) metric ( Cai and Knight , 2013 ) .
The left block of Table 1 shows the SMATCH scores on the AMR 2.0 test set of our models against the previous best approaches and recent competitors .
On AMR 2.0 , we outperform the latest push from Zhang et al .
( 2019b ) by 3.2 % and , for the ﬁrst time , obtain a parser with over 80 % SMATCH score .
Note that even without BERT , our model still outperforms the previous state - of - the - art approaches using BERT ( Zhang et al . , 2019b , a ) with 77.3 % .
This is particularly remarkable since running BERT is computationally expensive .
As shown in Table 2 , on AMR 1.0 where the training instances are only around 10 K , we improve the best - reported results by 4.1 % and reach at 75.4 % , which is already higher than

most models trained on AMR 2.0 .
The even more substantial performance gain on the smaller dataset suggests that our method is both effective and dataefﬁcient .
Besides , again , our model without BERT already surpasses previous state - of - the - art results using BERT .
For ablated models , it can be observed that our models yield the best results in all settings if there are any competitors , indicating BERT and graph re - categorization are not the exclusive key for our superior performance .
Fine - grained Results
In order to investigate how our parser performs on individual sub - tasks , we also use the ﬁne - grained evaluation tool ( Damonte et al . , 2017 ) and compare to systems which reported these scores.8As shown in the right block of Table 1 , our best model obtains the highest scores on almost all sub - tasks .
The improvements in all sub - tasks are consistent and uniform ( around 2%3 % ) compared to the previous state - of - the - art performance ( Zhang et al . , 2019b ) , partly conﬁrming that our model boosts performance via consolidated and harmonious decisions rather than ﬁxing particular phenomena .
By our ablation study , 8We only list the results on AMR 2.0 since there are few results on AMR 1.0 to compare .

Sentences are grouped by length .
it is worth noting that the NER scores are much lower when using graph re - categorization .
This is because the rule - based system for NER in graph recategorization does not generalize well to unseen entities , which suggest a potential improvement by adapting better NER taggers .
6.3 More Analysis Effect of Iterative Inference
We then turn to study the effect of our key idea , namely , the iterative inference design .
To this end , we run a set of experiments with different values of the number of the inference steps
N.
The results on AMR 2.0 are shown in Figure 4 ( solid line ) .
As seen , the performance generally goes up when the number of inference steps increases .
The difference is most noticeable between 1 ( no iterative reasoning is performed ) and 2 , while later improvements gradually diminish .
One important point here is that the model size in terms of the number of parameters is constant regardless of the number of inference steps , making it different from general over - parameterized problems .

1.00.50.0 Figure 5 : Case study ( viewed in color ) .
Color shading intensity represents the value of the attention score .
For a closer study on the effect of the inference steps with respect to the lengths of input sentences , we group sentences into three classes by length and also show the individual results in Figure 4 ( dashed lines ) .
As seen , the iterative inference helps more for longer sentences , which conﬁrms our intuition that longer and more complex input needs more reasoning .
Another interesting observation is that the performance on shorter sentences reaches the peaks earlier .
This observation suggests that the number of inference steps can be adjusted according to the input sentence , which we leave as future work .
Effect of Beam Size We are also interested in the effect of beam size during testing .
Ideally , if a model is able to make accurate predictions in the ﬁrst place , it should rely less on the search algorithm .
We vary the beam size and plot the curve in Figure 6 .
The results show that the performance generally gets better with larger beam sizes .
However , a small beam size of 2 already gets the most of the credits , which suggests that our model is robust enough for time - stressing environments .
Visualization We visualize the iterative reasoning process with a case study in Figure 5 .
We illustrate the values of  t ;  tas the iterative inference progresses .
As seen , the parser makes mistakes in the ﬁrst step , but gradually corrects its decisions and ﬁnally makes the right predictions .
Later reasoning steps typically provide a sharper attention distribution than earlier steps , narrowing down the most likely answer with more conﬁdence .
Speed We also report the parsing speed of our non - optimized code : With BERT , the parsing speed of our system is about 300 tokens / s , while without BERT , it is about 330 tokens / s on a single Nvidia P4 GPU .
The absolute speed depends on various implementation choices and hardware performance .

In theory , the time complexity of our parsing algorithm isO(kbn ) , wherekis the number of iterative steps , bis beam size , and nis the graph size ( number of nodes ) respectively .
It is important to note that our algorithm is linear in the graph size .
7 Conclusion We presented the dual graph - sequence iterative inference method for AMR Parsing .
Our method constructs an AMR graph incrementally in a nodeby - node fashion .
Each spanning step is explicitly characterized as answering two questions : which parts of the sequence to abstract , and where in the graph to construct .
We leverage the mutual causalities between the two and design an iterative inference algorithm .
Our model signiﬁcantly advances the state - of - the - art results on two AMR corpora .
An interesting future work is to make the number of inference steps adaptive to input sentences .
Also , the idea proposed in this paper may be applied to a broad range of structured prediction tasks ( not only restricted to other semantic parsing tasks ) where the complex output space can be divided into two interdependent parts with a similar iterative inference process to achieve harmonious predictions and better performance .

1301A Hyper - parameter Settings Table 3 lists the hyper - parameters used in our full models .
Char - level CNNs and Transformer layers in the sentence encoder and the graph encoder share the same hyper - parameter settings .
The BERT model ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) we used is the Huggingface ’s implementation ( Wolf et al . , 2019 ) ( bert - base - cased ) .
To mitigate overﬁtting , we apply dropout ( Srivastava et al . , 2014 ) with the drop rate0:2between different layers .
We randomly mask ( replacing inputs with a special UNK token ) the input lemmas , POS tags , and NER tags with a rate of 0:33 .
Parameter optimization is performed with the ADAM optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) with  1= 0:9and  2= 0:999 .
The learning rate schedule is similar to that in Vaswani
et
al . ( 2017 ) , with warm - up steps being set to 2K. We use early stopping on the development set for choosing the best model .
B AMR Pre- and Post - processing
We follow exactly the same pre- and postprocessing steps of those of Zhang et al .
( 2019a , b ) for graph re - categorization .
In preprocessing , we anonymize entities , remove wiki links and polarity attributes , and convert the resultant AMR graphs into a compact format by compressing certain subgraphs .
In post - processing , we recover the original AMR format from the compact format , restore Wikipedia links using the DBpedia Spotlight API ( Daiber et al . , 2013 ) , add polarity attributes based on rules observed from the training data .
