Many recent works on ABSA focus on Targetoriented Opinion Words ( or Terms ) Extraction ( TOWE ) , which aims at extracting the corresponding opinion words for a given opinion target .
TOWE can be further applied to AspectOpinion Pair Extraction ( AOPE ) which aims at extracting aspects ( i.e. , opinion targets ) and opinion terms in pairs .
In this paper , we propose Target- Speciﬁed sequence labeling with Multi - head Self - Attention ( TSMSA ) for TOWE , in which any pre - trained language model with multi - head self - attention can be integrated conveniently .
As a case study , we also develop a Multi - Task structure named MTTSMSA for AOPE by combining our TSMSA with an aspect and opinion term extraction module .
Experimental results indicate that TSMSA outperforms the benchmark methods on TOWE signiﬁcantly ; meanwhile , the performance of MT - TSMSA is similar or even better than state - of - the - art AOPE baseline models .
1 Introduction Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) ( Pontiki et al . , 2014 ) has attracted much attention of researchers in recent years .
In ABSA , aspect ( or called opinion target ) extraction and opinion term extraction are two fundamental tasks .
Aspect is the word or phrase in the reviews referring to the object towards which users show attitudes , while opinion terms are those words or phrases representing users ’ attitudes ( Wu et al . , 2020 ) .
For example , in the sentence “ The dim sum is delicious .
” , the phrase “ dim sum ” is an aspect and the word “ delicious ” is an opinion term .
See the upper part of Table 1 for more examples .
Plenty of works based on neural networks have been done in both aspect The corresponding author .
Reviews : “ Soooo great !
The food is delicious and inexpensive , and the environment is in a nice .
The only problem is that the soup and dessert are ordinary . "
Aspect - Opinion Pairs : food :
[ delicious , inexpensive ] ( one - to - many ) environment : [ nice ] ( one - to - one ) soup , dessert :
[ ordinary ] ( many - to - one ) Table 1 : The upper part is a restaurant review and the lower part shows the corresponding aspect - opinion pairs .
Extracted aspects and opinion terms are marked in red and blue , respectively .
and opinion term extraction ( Liu et al . , 2015 ; Poria et
al . , 2016 ; Xu et al . , 2018 ) ; moreover , some studies combine these two tasks into a multi - task structure to extract aspects and opinion terms simultaneously ( Wang et al . , 2016 , 2017 ; Li and Lam , 2017 ; Dai and Song , 2019 ) .
However , one critical deﬁciency in the researches mentioned above is that they ignore the relation of aspects and opinion terms , which leads to the birth of Target - oriented Opinion Words ( or Terms ) Extraction ( TOWE ) ( Fan et al . , 2019 ) for extracting the corresponding opinion terms of a given opinion target .
Subsequently , Aspect - Opinion Pair Extraction ( AOPE ) ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) and Pair - wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction ( PAOTE ) ( Zhao et al . , 2020 ) have emerged , which both aim at extracting aspects and opinion terms in pairs .
AOPE and PAOTE are exactly the same task , only named differently .
In the following , we use AOPE to denote this task for simplicity .
It can be considered that AOPE contains aspect and opinion word extraction and TOWE .
Since aspect extraction has been fully studied and satisfactory results have been obtained , TOWE , which aims at mining the relation between aspects and opinion terms , is the key to the AOPE task .
As shown in the lower part of Table 1 , the relational structure of
1806the aspect - opinion pairs within a sentence can be complicated , including one - to - one , one - to - many , and many - to - one .
The challenge of TOWE is the learning of representations of the given opinion target accurately and a few works focus on this task .
For instance , Fan et al .
( 2019 ) propose an Inward - Outward LSTM to pass target information to the left context and the right context of the target respectively , and then they combine the left , right , and global context to encode the sentence .
Recently , SDRN ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) and SpanMlt ( Zhao et
al . , 2020 ) both adopt a pre - trained language model to learn contextual representations for AOPE .
In SDRN , a double - channel recurrent network and a synchronization unit are applied to extract aspects , opinion terms and their relevancy .
In SpanMlt , the terms are extracted under annotated span boundaries with contextual representations , and then the relations between every two span combinations are identiﬁed .
However , apart from hyper - parameters in the pre - trained language model , these two methods introduce many other hyper - parameters ( e.g. , the hidden size , thresholds and recurrent steps in SDRN , and the span length , top kspans and the balanced factor of different tasks in SpanMlt ) .
Some of these hyper - parameters have a signiﬁcant impact on the model performance .
Motivated by the previous work and to address the challenges mentioned above , we propose a Target- Speciﬁed sequence labeling method based onMulti - head Self - Attention ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) ( TSMSA ) .
The sentence is ﬁrst processed in the format “ [ SEP ] Aspect
[ SEP ] ” ( e.g. , “ The [ SEP ] food [ SEP ] is delicious . ” ) , which is inspired by Soares et al .
( 2019 ) who utilized a special symbol “ [ SEP ] ” to label all entities and output their corresponding representations .
Then we develop a sequence labeling model based on multi - head self - attention to identify the corresponding opinion terms .
By using the special symbol and self - attention mechanism , TSMSA is capable of capturing the information of the speciﬁc aspect .
To improve the performance of our model , we apply pre - trained language models like BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) which contain a multi - head self - attention module as the encoder .
As a case study , we integrate aspect and opinion term extraction , and TOWE into a Multi - Task architecture named MT - TSMSA to validate the effectiveness of our method on the AOPE task .
In addition , apart from hyper - parameters in the pre - trained language model , we only need to adjust the balanced factor of different tasks in MT - TSMSA .
In summary , our main contributions are as follows : •We propose a target - speciﬁed sequence labeling method with multi - head self - attention mechanism to perform TOWE , which generates target - speciﬁc context representations for different targets in the same review with the special symbol and multi - head self - attention .
Pre - trained language models can be conveniently applied to improve the performance .
•For our TSMSA and MT - TSMSA , only a small amount of hyper - parameters need to be adjusted when using pre - trained language models .
Compared to the existing models for TOWE and AOPE , we alleviate the tradeoff issue between a model ’s complexity and performance .
Extensive experiments validate that our TSMSA can achieve the best performance on TOWE , and MT - TSMSA performs quite competitive on AOPE .
The rest of this paper is organized as follows .
Section 2 introduces the existing studies on TOWE and AOPE , respectively .
Section 3 details the proposed TSMSA and MT - TSMSA .
Section 4 presents our experimental results and discussions .
Finally , we draw conclusions in Section 5 .

Related Works 2.1 Target - oriented Opinion Words Extraction Plenty of works have been carried out for aspect extraction and opinion term extraction .
Early researches can be divided into unsupervised / semisupervised methods ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ; Zhuang et al . , 2006 ;
Qiu et al . , 2011 ) and supervised methods ( Jakob and Gurevych , 2010 ; Shu et al . , 2017 ) .
With the development of neural networks , deep learning methods ( Liu et al . , 2015 ; Yin et al . , 2016 ; Poria et
al . , 2016 ; Xu et al . , 2018 ) have made impressive progress in recent years .
Several works integrate aspect extraction and opinion term extraction into a co - extraction process .
Qiu et al .
( 2011 ) expand the list of aspects and opinion terms in a bootstrapping method by double propagation .
Some other works adopt the co - extraction structure in neural networks with multi - task learning ( Wang et al . , 2016 , 2017 ; Li and Lam , 2017 ) .
However , the above methods ignore the relation between aspects and opinion terms and only a few
1807works focus on this ﬁeld .
Rule - based methods ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ; Zhuang et
al . , 2006 ) are proposed to select corresponding opinion terms with distance rule and syntactic rule templates based on dependency parsing trees .
However , the performance of these methods heavily relies on expert knowledge and these rules usually cover only a small amount of cases .
Fan et al .
( 2019 ) carry out TOWE by extracting the corresponding opinion terms for a given aspect , and then utilize Inward - Outward LSTM to generate implicit representations of aspects .
Nevertheless , this approach is not capable of applying powerful pre - trained language models like BERT as the encoder to perform better .
Our model aims to extract corresponding opinion terms of the given aspect with explicit representations , in addition to boost performance by employing BERT as the encoder .
2.2 Aspect - Opinion Pair Extraction Aspect - Opinion Pair Extraction ( AOPE ) ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) and Pair - wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction ( PAOTE ) ( Zhao et al . , 2020 ) both aim at extracting aspects and opinion terms in pairs .
AOPE and PAOTE are essentially the same task with different names , and they can be split into aspect extraction and TOWE .
Chen et al .
( 2020 ) propose a Synchronous Double - channel Recurrent Network ( SDRN ) which consists of an opinion entity extraction unit , a relation detection unit , and a synchronization unit for pair extraction .
Zhao et al .
( 2020 ) develop a span - based multi - task learning framework ( SpanMlt ) where the terms are extracted under annotated span boundaries , so as to identify the relations between every two span combinations .
However , SDRN contains a lot of hyperparameters and SpanMlt generates a great many of candidate spans if the value of maximal length of a span is large or the sentence is too long .
The advantage of our methods is that only a small amount of hyper - parameters adjustment is required and similar or even better performance can be achieved .
3 Methodology 3.1 Task Description Given a sentence s = fw1;w2;:::;w ngconsisting ofnwords , an aspect ( opinion target ) a= fwi;wi+1;:::;w i+kg , and an opinion term o= fwj;wj+1;:::;w j+mg(aandoare substrings of s ) , the probabilities of target - oriented opinion terms are deﬁned as p(ojs;a)in the TOWE task and theprobabilities of aspect - opinion pairs are deﬁned as p(ha;oijs )
= p(ajs)p(ojs;a)in the AOPE task .
The BIO tagging scheme ( Ramshaw and Marcus , 1995 ) and a special symbol “ [ SEP ] ” are applied to this task , where each word wiin the sentence sis tagged asyi2{B , I , O , [ SEP ] } ( B : Beginning , I :
Inside , O : Others , [ SEP ] : the tag of an aspect ) .
3.2 Framework The structures of our Target- Speciﬁed sequence labeling method based on Multi - head Self - Attention ( TSMSA ) and the Multi - Task version ( MTTSMSA ) are shown in Figure 1 ( c ) and ( d ) .
As aforementioned , we ﬁrst use a special symbol “ [ SEP ] ” to label each aspect .
Next , the multi - head self - attention method is applied to capture the context representations of the speciﬁc aspect explicitly , then they are passed to a projection layer and a Conditional Random Field ( CRF ) ( Lafferty et al . , 2001 ) layer for sequence labeling .
Furthermore , the aspect and opinion words extraction ( task 0 ) as well as the target - oriented opinion words extraction ( task 1 ) are combined for multi - task learning .
These two tasks share the parameters of encoder but differ in projection and CRF layers .
3.3 Multi - Head Self - Attention We describe the multi - head self - attention approach according to Vaswani
et
al .
( 2017 ) with the details shown in Figure 1 ( a ) and ( b ) .
For each attention head in the above approach , we ﬁrst compute the scaled dot - product attention .
Particularly , the input consists of a set of queries , keys , and values , where dkstands for the dimension of queries and keys , anddvrepresents the dimension of values .
Then they are packed together into matrices Q , K , and V , respectively .
The scaled dot - product attention is calculated as follows : Attention ( Q;K;V )
= softmax ( QKT pdk)V : ( 1 ) Next , given the number of attention heads h , we can get the dimension of output dmodel = hdv .
Finally , the multi - head attention is described as follows : MH(I;h )
= Concat ( head 1;:::;head h)WO ; ( 2 ) head i = Attention ( IWQ i;IWK i;IWV i);(3 ) whereI = f ~ i1;~i2;:::;~ing(the dimension of ~iis dmodel ) indicates the input and nis the sequence

The parameter matrices of projections are WQ i2Rdmodeldk , WK i2Rdmodeldk , WV i2 Rdmodeldv , andWO i2Rdmodeldmodel .
3.4 Target - Speciﬁed Encoder To start with , the input vector of each word is generated by utilizing a word embedding lookup tableLw2Rrdwand a positional embedding lookup table Lp2Rndp , wheredwis the dimension of word embeddings , ris the vocabulary size , anddpis the dimension of positional embeddings .
These embedding lookup tables will map s= fw1;:::;w ngtof~ e1w ; : : : ; ~ e nwgandf~ e1p ; : : : ; ~ e npg , respectively .
For our base models ( not using a pre - trained language model ) , ~ eiwwill be projected to a low dimensional vector ~ eilowwhich is calculated as follows : ~ eilow=(We~ eiw ) , where We2Rdlowdw(dlow < dw ) denotes the matrix of projection and ()is the activation function .
In this case,~tiin the input T = f ~ t1;:::;~tngis represented by [ ~ eilow;~ eip]anddmodel = dlow+dp .
For a pre - trained language model like BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) , ~tiequals the sum of ~ eiw,~
eip , and~ eis , wherees = f~ e1s ; : : : ; ~ e nsg(the dimension of~ eisisdp ) represents segment embeddings , and dmodel = dp = dw .
Then , the input vector Tis passed to multihead self - attention modules , where a feed - forward network and an add - norm network are combined in sequence to generate the context representation of each layer H = fH1;:::;Hlg , wherel is the number of multi - head attention layers and Hi = f ~ H1i;:::;~Hnig . Hican be calculated asfollows :
Oi = MH(Hi 1;h ) ; ( 4 ) FFNi = max(0;OiWi 1+bi 1)Wi 2+bi 2;(5 )
Hi = LN(Hi 1+FFNi ) ; ( 6 ) wherehis the number of attention heads , H0= T , the matrices Wi 12RdmodeldffandWi 22 Rdffdmodel represent mappings from dmodel to dffand back todmodel .LN()is
a layer normalization method applying to sequential data ( Ba et al . , 2016 ) .
Finally , the output of the encoder is Hl , i.e. , the last layer of H. 3.5 Decoder and Training Given a sequential representation Hland a sequential labelY = fy1;:::;y ng(yi2{B , I , O , [ SEP ] } oryi2{B - ASP , I - ASP , B - OP , I - OP , O}1 ) , we can useHlto computep(YjHl ) .
Greedy decoding or CRF can be adopted in the decoding process .
CRF is chosen as our decoding strategy because CRF has the ability to capture the correlations between tokens and labels and the correlations between adjacent labels simultaneously .
Given a new sentence , we use Viterbi algorithm ( Viterbi , 1967 ) to predict the label sequence by maximizing the conditional probabilityp(YjHl)in the decoding process .
3.5.1 Single - Task Version The single - task version of our approaches is TSMSA .
Given a predicted label sequence Yand 1B - ASP : beginning of an aspect , I - ASP : inside of an aspect , B - OP : beginning of an opinion term , I - OP : inside of an opinion term , and O : others .
1809a sequential representation Hl , the score function S(Hl;Y)can be deﬁned as follows : S(Hl;Y )
= nX i=1Qyi 1;yi+nX i=1Pi;yi ; ( 7 ) P = HlWp+bp ; ( 8) where the matrix Q2Rkkcaptures the relation of adjacent labels , the matrix P2Rnklearns the relation of tokens and labels , and the matricesWp2Rdmodelkandbp2Rnkindicate a projection operation from dimension dmodel to dimensionk .
In the above , kmeans the dimension of the label space .
Then , the linear - chain CRF is exploited to calculate the conditional probability of the predicted sequence Yas follows : p(YjHl )
= exp(S(Hl;Y))P ~Y2Yallexp(S(Hl;~Y));(9 ) whereYalldenotes the set of all possible sequential labels .
So the loss of a sentence can be calculated by the negative log likelihood as follows : L(s ) =  logp(YjHl ): ( 10 ) 3.5.2 Multi - Task Version By integrating aspect and opinion term extraction ( task 0 ) and TOWE ( task 1 ) into a multi - task architecture , we propose a MT - TSMSA method for AOPE .
MT - TSMSA can be deﬁned as using a sentenceHland a task id2f0;1gto calculate the conditional probability p(YjHl;id ) .
When the task i d equals 0 , it means aspect and opinion term extraction .
For TOWE , the task i d is 1 .
Some examples are shown in Figure 1 ( d ) .
Aiming at handling different tasks , different score functions S0(Hl;Y0 ) andS1(Hl;Y1)are deﬁned , where S0()andS1( ) have different parameter matrices , Y0(Y0 i2{BASP , I - ASP , B - OP , I - OP O } ) and Y1(Y1 i2{B , I , O , [ SEP ] } ) represent the sequential labels of aspect and opinion term extraction , and TOWE , respectively .
So the conditional probabilities of the predicted sequences Y0andY1can be calculated as follows : p(Y0jHl;id= 0 )
= exp(S0(Hl;Y0))P ~Y2Y0 allexp(S0(Hl;~Y ) ) ; ( 11 ) p(Y1jHl;id= 1 ) = exp(S1(Hl;Y1))P ~Y2Y1 allexp(S1(Hl;~Y ) ) ; ( 12)whereY0 alldenotes the set of all possible sequential labels of task 0 and Y1 allrepresents the set of all possible sequential labels of task 1 .
The loss of a sentence is also calculated by the negative log likelihood as follows : L(s;id ) =  logp(YjHl;id ): ( 13 ) GivenMsentencesS = fs1;s2;:::;s Mgwith id = fid1;:::;id Mg , we can minimize the loss for training : J( ) = MX k=1((1 idk)+idk)L(sk;idk);(14 )
whereis the hyper - parameter used to balance these two tasks .
3.6 Inference Process For TOWE , a sentence with a given aspect ( i.e. , target ) is ﬁrst processed into target - speciﬁed mode ( “ [ SEP ] Aspect
[ SEP ] ” ) with the special symbol “ [ SEP ] ”
and then passed into TSMSA , the outputs of which are the target - oriented opinion terms .
For AOPE , MT - TSMSA generates aspect - opinion pairs by a two - stage inference process .
Firstly , a sentence is passed into MT - TSMSA , where aspects are extracted in task 0 .
Secondly , given extracted aspects , repeating the inference process of TOWE , MT - TSMSA outputs the target - oriented opinion terms from task 1 .
Accordingly , the combinations of aspects from task 0 and target - orient opinion terms from task 1 are aspect - opinion pairs .
4 Experiments 4.1 Datasets To evaluate the performance of our model2 , we conduct experiments on two public datasets from laptop and restaurant domains .
These two datasets were respectively built by Fan et al .
( 2019 ) for TOWE and Chen et al .
( 2020 ) for AOPE based on SemEval Challenge 2014 Task 4 , SemEval Challenge 2015 Task 12 , and SemEval Challenge 2016 Task 5 ( Pontiki et al . , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 ) .
For the ﬁrst dataset , every sentence was annotated by two people , and the conﬂicts were checked and eliminated manually .
The second dataset was developed by extending the ﬁrst one .
The statistics of these benchmark datasets are shown in Table 2 , from 2The code of our model is available in public at : https : //github.com / fengyh3 / TSMSA .
1810which we can observe that the second dataset includes many negative samples for AOPE ( i.e. , the sentences only contain aspects and opinion terms , without any aspect - opinion pairs ) .
Note that these negative samples will also be considered when testing our model on AOPE .

# Sent , # Target , # A , and # None represent the numbers of sentences , relations , and aspects , and the sentences without any aspects and opinion terms , respectively .
4.2 Baselines Fan et al .
( 2019 ) have employed various baselines in TOWE , including Distance - rule ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) , Dependency - rule ( Zhuang et al . , 2006 ) , BiLSTM + Distance - rule , and TC - BiLSTM , except for BERT - based methods .
To achieve comprehensive comparative analysis , we develop baselines of BERT + Distance - rule andTarget - fused BERT ( TF - BERT ) for this task .
The former trains a sentence - level opinion term extraction model by BERT , and the target - oriented opinion term is the one nearest to each aspect .
The latter utilizes the average pooling of target word embeddings to represent the target information .
The word representation at each position is the addition of word embedding and target information , which is fed into BERT to extract target - oriented opinion terms .
Zhao et
al .
( 2020 ) have applied some baselines in AOPE , including HAST ( Li et al . , 2018 )
+ IOG andJERE - MHS ( Bekoulis et al . , 2018 ) .
Besides the above methods , we also employ the following baselines : •IOG ( Fan et al . , 2019 ) utilizes an InwardOutward LSTM and a Global LSTM to capture the information of aspects and global information respectively , then it combines these information for sequence labeling .
•SpanMlt ( Zhao et al . , 2020 ) is a span - based multi - task learning framework where the termsare extracted with annotated span boundaries and then the relations between combinations of every two spans are identiﬁed .
•SDRN ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) utilizes BERT as the encoder which consists of an opinion entity extraction unit , a relation detection unit , and a synchronization unit for the AOPE task .
In the case of TOWE , this model extracts the target - oriented opinion terms with given correct aspects .
4.3 Hyper - parameter Settings For the TOWE task , Fan et al .
( 2019 ) utilize 300dimension GloVe ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) vectors which are pre - trained on unlabeled data of 840 billion tokens to initialize word embedding vectors in IOG .
The word embeddings are ﬁxed at the stage of training .
For fair comparison , we use the same ﬁxed word embeddings in TSMSA(Base ) .
We randomly select 20 % of the training set as the development set for adjusting all hyper - parameters .
The value of dmodel is 128 , and the numbers of attention heads and layers are 4 and 6 , respectively .
In addition , the dropout rate , learning rate , and maximal sequence length are set to 0.5 , 0.001 , and 100 , respectively .
Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) is adopted to optimize our model .
Pretrained language models like BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) can be applied to our methods , and we adopt BERT - base3model , where dmodel is 768 and the number of attention heads and layers are both 12 .
Other hyper - parameters include the learning rate of BERT and CRF , the maximal sequence length , and the number of epochs .
Based on the development set , these hyper - parameters are set to 5e-5 , 2e-4 , 100 , and 8 , respectively .
Unless otherwise mentioned,is set to 1 .
To be consistent with various baselines ( Fan et al . , 2019 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020 ) , the term - level F1 score is used as the evaluation metric for both TOWE and AOPE tasks .
Term - level means that the boundaries of the span are the same as the ground - truth .
For the AOPE task , the consistency of a predicted aspect - opinion pair with the labeled pair indicates the correctness of prediction .

The methods in the upper part do not utilize the pre - trained language model ( i.e. , BERT ) and BERT is applied in the lower part .
The results with ‘ * ’ are reproduced by us , and others are released from Fan et
al .
( 2019 ) .
Best results are marked in bold .
based methods are poor because the rules only cover a small number of cases .
By utilizing BiLSTM or BERT as the encoder to extract opinion terms , the BiLSTM / BERT + Distance - rule perform much better than other rule - based methods .
However , these methods can not deal with the one - to - many case .
Secondly , TC - BiLSTM and TF - BERT extract static word embeddings for aspects and then incorporate them into sentence representation by concatenation or addition .
Nevertheless , the results of TC - BiLSTM and TF - BERT are still over 10 % lower than IOG / TSMSA(Base ) and SDRN / TSMSA(BERT ) , respectively .
It reveals that the static word embedding is not a good representation of the aspect and the concatenation / addition operation is not good enough to represent the speciﬁc aspect .
Finally , IOG is a state - ofthe - art baseline method for TOWE and the performance of TSMSA(Base ) trained by the same word embedding is similar to IOG , which indicates the effectiveness in capturing the representation of a speciﬁc aspect with the symbol “ [ SEP ] ” .
Furthermore , the pre - trained language model BERT can be applied to our basic method .
The F1 score of TSMSA(BERT ) is in average 8 % higher than TSMSA(Base ) and IOG .
SDRN , which also exploits BERT as the encoder , passes the information of the aspect through a synchronization unit and utilizes supervised self - attention to capture this information .
Nevertheless , it represents the speciﬁc aspect implicitly , which might have an negative impact on capturing the information of targets .
In average , the performance of SDRN is 2 % lower than TSMSA(BERT ) .
The overall results reveal that our proposed method achieves state - of - the - art performance on TOWE.4.4.2 Aspect - Opinion Pair Extraction As mentioned above , our method can be applied to AOPE by combining TOWE with aspect and opinion term extraction .
We here compare the performance of our multi - task model ( i.e. , MT - TSMSA ) with the following competitive models : HAST + IOG , JERE - MHS , SpanMlt , and SDRN .
The results are shown in Table 4 .
Note that the overlapping ratios of pairs in 14lap , 14res , and 15res are 78.8 % , 92 % , and 99.8 % for ( Fan et al . , 2019 ) , and 87.1 % , 86.2 % , and 86.4 % for ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) , respectively .
Thus , there is a difference ( within 2 % mostly ) between the results on these two datasets .

et al .
( 2020 ) and Chen et al .
( 2020 ) .
Best results are marked in bold .
The performance of JERE - MHS is better than HAST + IOG , which indicates that the degree of error propagation in the separate training model might be smaller than it in the model of joint training .
Moreover , SpanMlt , SDRN , and MTTSMSA(BERT ) use powerful pre - trained language models , which have a signiﬁcant improvement in the performance on AOPE .
We observe that SDRN and MT - TSMSA(BERT ) perform better than SpanMlt , showing that selecting top kspans from candidate spans as pairs might miss some correct pairs .
Compared to SDRN , MT - TSMSA(BERT ) performs better on three datasets and nearly the
1812same on four datasets .
Overall , MT - TSMSA achieves quite competitive performance on AOPE by simply incorporating our TSMSA into a multitask structure .
4.5 Ablation Experiments To evaluate the impacts of different word embeddings and training strategies on our models , we conduct ablation experiments by varying the above factors .
The results shown in Table 5 indicate that a suitable word embedding is capable of improving the performance of our models .
Firstly , BERT embedding shows poor performance when compared to Glove .
We conjecture that BERT embedding needs to cooperate with the pre - trained encoder of BERT to perform better on TOWE .
Secondly , applying the word embedding and the encoder of BERT without ﬁne - tuning also fails to work on TOWE .
The reason may be that the encoder of BERT without ﬁne - tuning can not capture the information of the speciﬁc aspect with the symbol “ [ SEP ] ” .
Furthermore , opinion terms extracted from task 0 help to identify the corresponding opinion terms in task 1 , which means that the multi - task structure is able to achieve better results than the single - task structure on TOWE .
Although the improvement is not signiﬁcant in average , we observe that the former structure can achieve more stable performance than the latter one .

4.6 Convergence and Sensitivity Studies The results of convergence and sensitivity studies are shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 ( a ) reveals that our model gradually converges as the number of epochs increases .
Although the dropout rate is set to 0.5 , it also converges smoothly .
Figure 2 ( b ) shows the effect of the number of attention heads .
When the number of attention heads is 4 , TSMSA(Base ) achieves stable and good performance , and as the value increased , the performance might be better .
Figure 2 ( c ) shows thatthe best performance is achieved when the number of multi - head self - attention layers is 6 , and as the number increased , the model might be confronted with overﬁtting .
Figure 2 ( d ) indicates the impact ofon our model which inﬂuences the learning of different tasks .
Stable and good results can be obtained when = 1 , and better performance can be achieved when the value is set to 0.5 or 2 .
Compared with other hyper - parameters , the results also indicate that has a relatively small impact on the model performance .

4.7 Visualization of Attention In this part , we apply an open source tool4to visualize the attention scores of TSMSA(BERT ) and describe two attention heads on the tenth layer in Figure 3 ( a ) and ( b ) , where attention scores less than 0.1 and unimportant words are not displayed .
As we can see , the words “ nice ” and “ great ” are both close to the aspect “ food ” , but “ nice ” will not pay attention to this aspect .
In addition , “ great ” and “ reasonable ” focus on the special symbol “ [ SEP ] ” and the speciﬁc aspect “ food ” , as shown in Figure 3 ( a ) .
At the same time , “ food ” gives attention to “ great ” and “ reasonable ” on different attention heads , as described in Figure 3 ( b ) .
All these instances reveal that multi - head self - attention mechanism is capable of capturing the representation of a 4https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz

4.8 Case Study To further compare our MT - TSMSA(BERT ) with the best - performing baseline of SDRN , we here conduct a case study by following ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) .
As shown in Table 6 , both SDRN and MTTSMSA(BERT ) perform well in extracting aspectopinion pairs from complicated relations .
But in some cases like Case 4 , SDRN misses the pair of ( watching videos , hot ) .
The reason may be that the massive hyper - parameters in SDRN have a great impact on the effect .
For example , the threshold  in the relation synchronization mechanism of SDRN will largely affect the results of the model .
On the other hand , our method can extract all the pairs because it introduces fewer hyper - parameters , which leads to stable results .
However , in Case 5 , our method can not extract the pair .
The rea - son is that task 0 of MT - TSMSA(BERT ) fails to extract the aspect term “ log into the system ” .
Moreover , the in - depth reason is that for the aspect term extraction task , the performance of SDRN ( i.e. , 83.67 % , 89.49 % , and 74.05 % ) is better than that of MT - TSMSA(BERT ) , i.e. , 83.11 % , 84.85 % , and 72.69 % on the datasets from ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) .
5 Conclusions In this paper , we propose a target - speciﬁed sequence labeling method based on multi - head selfattention ( TSMSA ) and a multi - task version ( MTTSMSA ) to deal with TOWE and AOPE , respectively .
In our methods , the encoder is capable of capturing the information of the speciﬁc aspect which is labeled by a special symbol “ [ SEP ] ” .
Experimental results demonstrate that TSMSA and MT - TSMSA achieve quite competitive performance in most cases .
When combining aspect and opinion words extraction with TOWE , our MTTSMSA can slightly improve the performance as compared with TSMSA .
In the future , we plan to extend our approaches to sentiment classiﬁcation of pairs and explore an efﬁcient model with a one - stage inference process to reduce the time complexity on AOPE .
