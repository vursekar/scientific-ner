A Uniﬁed Conversational Neural Architecture for Multi - domain Task - oriented Dialogues Hung Leyx , Doyen Sahooz , Chenghao Liuy , Nancy F. Chenx , Steven C.H. Hoiyz ySingapore Management University { hungle.2018,chliu}@smu.edu.sg zSalesforce Research Asia { dsahoo,shoi}@salesforce.com xInstitute for Infocomm Research , A*STAR nfychen@i2r.a-star.edu.sg Abstract Building an end - to - end conversational agent for multi - domain task - oriented dialogues has been an open challenge for two main reasons .
First , tracking dialogue states of multiple domains is non - trivial as the dialogue agent must obtain complete states from all relevant domains , some of which might have shared slots among domains as well as unique slots specifically for one domain only .
Second , the dialogue agent must also process various types of information across domains , including dialogue context , dialogue states , and database , to generate natural responses to users .
Unlike the existing approaches that are often designed to train each module separately , we propose “ UniConv " — a novel uniﬁed neural architecture for end - to - end conversational systems in multi - domain task - oriented dialogues , which is designed to jointly train ( i ) a Bi - level State Tracker which tracks dialogue states by learning signals at both slot and domain level independently , and ( ii ) a Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator which incorporates information from various input components and models dialogue acts and target responses simultaneously .
We conduct comprehensive experiments in dialogue state tracking , contextto - text , and end - to - end settings on the MultiWOZ2.1 benchmark , achieving superior performance over competitive baselines .
1 Introduction A conventional approach to task - oriented dialogues is to solve four distinct tasks : ( 1 ) natural language understanding ( NLU ) which parses user utterance into a semantic frame , ( 2 ) dialogue state tracking ( DST ) which updates the slots and values from semantic frames to the latest values for knowledge base retrieval , ( 3 ) dialogue policy which determines an appropriate dialogue act for the next system response , and ( 4 ) response generation which generates a natural language sequence conditioned onthe dialogue act .
This traditional pipeline modular framework has achieved remarkable successes in task - oriented dialogues ( Wen et al . , 2017 ; Liu and Lane , 2017 ; Williams et al . , 2017 ; Zhao et al . , 2017 ) .
However , such kind of dialogue system is not fully optimized as the modules are loosely integrated and often not trained jointly in an end - to - end manner , and thus may suffer from increasing error propagation between the modules as the complexity of the dialogues evolves .
A typical case of a complex dialogue setting is when the dialogue extends over multiple domains .
A dialogue state in a multi - domain dialogue should include slots of all applicable domains up to the current turn ( See Table 1 ) .
Each domain can have shared slots that are common among domains or unique slots that are not shared with any .
Directly applying single - domain DST to multi - domain dialogues is not straightforward because the dialogue states extend to multiple domains .
A possible approach is to process a dialogue of NDdomains multiple times , each time obtaining a dialogue state of one domain .
However , this approach does not allow learning co - reference in dialogues in which users can switch from one domain to another .
As the number of dialogue domains increases , traditional pipeline approaches propagate errors from dialogue states to dialogue policy and subsequently , to natural language generator .
Recent efforts ( Eric et al . , 2017 ; Madotto et al . , 2018 ; Wu et al . , 2019b ) address this problem with an integrated sequence - to - sequence structure .
These approaches often consider knowledge bases as memory tuples rather than relational entity tables .
While achieving impressive performance , these approaches are not scalable to large - scale knowledgebases , e.g. thousands of entities , as the memory cost to query entity attributes increases substantially .
Another limitation of these approaches is the absence of dialogue act modelling .
Dialogue act
1861Human : hello Dialogue agent : hi !
how can i help you ?
Dialogue state : { } Dialogue acts :
[ greeting ] Human : i would like a place to eat in the expensive price range Dialogue agent : sure , what type of food are you interested in ?
Dialogue state : { restaurant : { pricerange : expensive } } Dialogue acts : [ request - food ] Human : could you make a suggestion ?
one in the centre ?
Dialogue agent : ﬁtzbillies restaurant is an expensive british restaurant in the centre .
can i book that for you ?
Dialogue state : { restaurant : { pricerange : expensive , area : centre } } Dialogue acts : [ inform - restaurant , request - booking ] ... ...
Human : also , i need the number for kings hedges learner pool .Dialogue agent : the phone number for the pool is 01234567 , is there something else i can help you ?
Dialogue state : { restaurant : { pricerange : expensive , area : centre , name=ﬁzbillies restaurant , request=[address ] } , attraction : { name : kings hedges learner pool , request=[phone]}}Dialogue acts : [ inform - phone ] Table 1 : Example of a multi - domain dialogue with two domains : restaurant andattraction .
is particularly important in task - oriented dialogues as it determines the general decision towards task completion before a dialogue agent can materialize it into natural language response ( See Table 1 ) .
To tackle the challenges in multi - domain taskoriented dialogues while reducing error propagation among dialogue system modules and keeping the models scalable , we propose UniConv , a uniﬁed neural network architecture for end - to - end dialogue systems .
UniConv consists of a Bi - level State Tracking ( BDST ) module which embeds natural language understanding as it can directly parse dialogue context into a structured dialogue state rather than relying on the semantic frame output from an NLU module in each dialogue turn .
BDST implicitly models and integrates slot representations from dialogue contextual cues to directly generate slot values in each turn and thus , remove the need for explicit slot tagging features from an NLU .
This approach is more practical than the traditional pipeline models as we do not need slot tagging annotation .
Furthermore , BDST tracks dialogue states in dialogue context in both slot and domain levels .
The output representations from two levels are combined in a late fusion approach to learn multi - domain dialogue states .
Our dialogue state tracker disentangles slot and domain representation learning while enabling deep learning of shared representations of slots common among domains .
UniConv integrates BDST with a Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator ( DARG ) that simultaneously models dialogue acts and generates system responses by learning a latent variable representing dialogue acts and semantically conditioning output response tokens on this latent variable .
The multitask setting of DARG allows our models to model dialogue acts and utilize the distributed representations of dialogue acts , rather than hard discreteoutput values from a dialogue policy module , on output response tokens .
Our response generator incorporates information from dialogue input components and intermediate representations progressively over multiple attention steps .
The output representations are reﬁned after each step to obtain high - resolution signals needed to generate appropriate dialogue acts and responses .
We combine both BDST and DARG for end - to - end neural dialogue systems , from input dialogues to output system responses .
We evaluate our models on the large - scale MultiWOZ benchmark ( Budzianowski et al . , 2018 ) , and compare with the existing methods in DST , context - to - text generation , and end - to - end settings .
The promising performance in all tasks validates the efﬁcacy of our method .
2 Related Work Dialogue State Tracking .
Traditionally , DST models are designed to track states of singledomain dialogues such as WOZ ( Wen et al . , 2017 ) and DSTC2 ( Henderson et al . , 2014a ) benchmarks .
There have been recent efforts that aim to tackle multi - domain DST such as ( Ramadan et al . , 2018 ; Lee et al . , 2019 ; Wu et al . , 2019a ; Goel et al . , 2019 ) .
These models can be categorized into two main categories : Fixed vocabulary models ( Zhong et al . , 2018 ; Ramadan et al . , 2018 ; Lee et al . , 2019 ) , which assume known slot ontology with a ﬁxed candidate set for each slot .
On the other hand , open - vocabulary models ( Lei et al . , 2018 ; Wu et al . , 2019a ; Gao et al . , 2019 ;
Ren et al . , 2019 ; Le et al . , 2020 ) derive the candidate set based on the source sequence i.e. dialogue history , itself .
Our approach is more related to the open - vocabulary approach as we aim to generate unique dialogue states depending on the input dialogue .

generation - based approaches
, our state tracker can incorporate contextual information into domain and slot representations independently .
Context - to - Text Generation .
This task was traditionally solved by two separate dialogue modules :
Dialogue Policy ( Peng et al . , 2017 , 2018 ) and NLG ( Wen et al . , 2016 ; Su et al . , 2018 ) .
Recent work attempts to combine these two modules to directly generate system responses with or without modeling dialogue acts .
Zhao et
al .
( 2019 ) models action space of dialogue agent as latent variables .
Chen et al .
( 2019 ) predicts dialogue acts using a hierarchical graph structure with each path representing a unique act .
Pei et al .
( 2019 ) ;
Peng et al .
( 2019 ) use multiple dialogue agents , each trained for a speciﬁc dialogue domain , and combine them through a common dialogue agent .
Mehri et al .
( 2019 ) models dialogue policy and NLG separately and fuses feature representations at different levels to generate responses .
Our models simultaneously learn dialogue acts as a latent variable while allowing semantic conditioning on distributed representations of dialogue acts rather than hard discrete features .
End - to - End Dialogue Systems .
In this task , conventional approaches combine Natural Language Understanding ( NLU ) , DST , Dialogue Policy , and NLG , into a pipeline architecture ( Wenet al . , 2017 ; Bordes et al . , 2016 ; Liu and Lane , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2017 ; Liu and Perez , 2017 ; Williams et al . , 2017 ;
Zhao et
al . , 2017 ; Jhunjhunwala et al . , 2020 ) .
Another framework does not explicitly modularize these components but incorporate them through a sequence - to - sequence framework ( Serban et al . , 2016 ; Lei et al . , 2018 ; Yavuz et al . , 2019 ) and a memory - based entity dataset of triplets ( Eric and Manning , 2017 ; Eric et al . , 2017 ; Madotto et al . , 2018 ; Qin et al . , 2019 ; Gangi Reddy et al . , 2019 ; Wu et al . , 2019b ) .
These approaches bypass dialogue state and/or act modeling and aim to generate output responses directly .
They achieve impressive success in generating dialogue responses in open - domain dialogues with unstructured knowledge bases .
However , in a task - oriented setting with an entity dataset , they might suffer from an explosion of memory size when the number of entities from multiple dialogue domains increases .
Our work is more related to the traditional pipeline strategy but we integrate our dialogue models by unifying two major components rather than using the traditional four - module architecture , to alleviate error propagation from upstream to downstream components .
Different from prior work such as ( Shu et al . , 2019 ) , our model facilitates multi - domain state tracking and allows learning dialogue acts
1863during response generation .
3 Method The input consists of dialogue context of t 1turns , each including a pair of user utterance Uand system response R,(U1 ; R1 ) ; : : : ; ( Ut 1 ; Rt 1 ) , and the user utterance at current turn Ut .
A taskoriented dialogue system aims to generate the next response Rt .
The information for responses is typically queried from a database based on the user ’s provided information i.e. inform slots tracked by a DST .
We assume access to a database of all domains with each column corresponding to a speciﬁc slot being tracked .
We denote the intermediate output , including the dialogue state of current turn Btand dialogue act as At .
We denote the list of all domains D= ( d1 ; d2 ; : : :) , all slots S= ( s1 ; s2 ; : : :) , and all acts A= ( a1 ; a2 ; : : :) .
We also denote the list of all ( domain , slot ) pairs asDS
= ( ds1 ; ds2 ; : : :) .
Note thatkDSk  kDkkSkas some slots might not be applicable in all domains .
Given the current dialogue turn t , we represent each text input as a sequence of tokens , each of which is a unique token index from a vocabulary set V : dialogue context Xctx , current user utterance Xutt , and target system response Xres .
Similarly , we also represent the list of domains as XDand the list of slots as XS .
In DST , we consider the raw text form of dialogue state of the previous turn Bt 1 , similarly as ( Lei et al . , 2018 ; Budzianowski and Vuli ´ c , 2019 ) .
In the context - to - text setting , we assume access to the ground - truth dialogue states of current turn Bt .
The dialogue state of the previous and current turn can then be represented as a sequence of tokens Xprev st andXcurr strespectively .
For a fair comparison with current approaches , during inference , we use the model predicted dialogue states ^Xprev stand do not useXcurr stin DST and end - to - end tasks .
Following ( Wen et al . , 2015 ; Budzianowski et al . , 2018 ) , we consider the delexicalized target response Xdl res by replacing tokens of slot values by their corresponding generic tokens to allow learning valueindependent parameters .
Our model consists of 3 major components ( See Figure 1 ) .
First , Encoders encode all text input into continuous representations .
To make it consistent , we encode all input with the same embedding dimension .
Secondly , our Bi - level State Tracker ( BDST ) is used to detect contextual dependencies to generate dialogue states .
The DST includes 2modules for slot - level and domain - level representation learning .
Each module comprises attention layers to project domain or slot representations and incorporate important information from dialogue context , dialogue state of the previous turn , and current user utterance .
The outputs are combined as a context - aware vector to decode the correspondinginform orrequest slots in each domain .
Lastly , ourJoint Dialogue Act and Response Generator ( DARG ) projects the target system response representations and enhances them with information from various dialogue components .
Our response generator can also learn a latent representation to generate dialogue acts , which condition all target tokens during each generation step .
3.1 Encoders An encoder encodes a text sequence Xto a sequence of continuous representation Z2RLXd .
LXis the length of sequence Xanddis the embedding dimension .
Each encoder includes a token - level embedding layer .
The embedding layer is a trainable embedding matrix E2RkVkd .
Each row represents a token in the vocabulary set Vas ad - dimensional vector .
We denote E(X ) as the embedding function that transform the sequence Xby looking up the respective token index : Zemb = E(X)2RLXd .
We inject the positional attribute of each token as similarly adopted in ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) .
The positional encoding is denoted as PE .
The ﬁnal embedding is the element - wise summation between token - embedded representations and positional encoded representations with layer normalization ( Ba et al . , 2016 ): Z= LayerNorm ( Zemb+PE(X))2RLXd .
The encoder outputs include representations of dialogue context Zctx , current user utterance Zutt , and target response Zdl res .
We also encode the dialogue states of the previous turn and current turn and obtain Zprev standZcurr strespectively .
We encode XSandXDusing only token - level embedding layer : ZS= LayerNorm ( E(XS))and ZD= LayerNorm ( E(XD ) ) .
During training , we shift the target response by one position to the left side to allow auto - regressive prediction in each generation step .
We share the embedding matrix Eto encode all text tokens except for tokens of target responses as the delexicalized outputs contain different semantics from natural language inputs .
18643.2 Bi - level Dialogue State Tracker ( BDST ) Slot - level DST .
We adopt the Transformer attention ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) , which consists of a dot - product attention with skip connection , to integrate dialogue contextual information into each slot representation .
We denote Att(Z1 ; Z2)as the attention operation from Z2onZ1 .
We ﬁrst enable models to process all slot representations together rather than separately as in previous DST models ( Ramadan et al . , 2018 ; Wu et al . , 2019a ) .
This strategy allows our models to explicitly learn dependencies between all pairs of slots .
Many pairs of slots could exhibit correlation such as time - wise relation ( “ departure_time " and “ arrival_time " ) .
We obtain Zdst SS= Att ( ZS ; ZS)2RkSkd .
We incorporate the dialogue information by learning dependencies between each slot representation and each token in the dialogue history .
Previous approaches such as ( Budzianowski and Vuli ´ c , 2019 ) consider all dialogue history as a single sequence but we separate them into two inputs because the information in Xuttis usually more important to generate responses while Xctxincludes more background information .
We then obtain Zdst S;ctx= Att ( Zctx ; Zdst SS)2RkSkdand Zdst S;utt= Att ( Zutt ; Zdst S;ctx)2RkSkd .
Following ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) , we incorporate dialogue state of the previous turn Bt 1which is a more compact representation of dialogue context .
Hence , we can replace the full dialogue context to only Rt 1as the remaining part is represented inBt 1 .
This approach avoids taking in all dialogue history and is scalable as the conversation grows longer .
We add the attention layer to obtainZdst S;st= Att ( Zprev st ; Zdst S;ctx)2RkSkd(See Figure 1 ) .
We further improve the feature representations by repeating the attention sequence over Ndst Stimes .
We denote the ﬁnal output Zdst S. Domain - level DST .
We adopt a similar architecture to learn domain - level representations .
The representations learned in this module exhibit global information while slot - level representations contain local dependencies to decode multi - domain dialogue states .
First , we enable the domain - level DST to capture dependencies between all pairs of domains .
For example , some domains such as “ taxi ” are typically paired with other domains such as “ attraction ” , but usually not with the “ train ” domain .
We then obtain Zdst DD= Att ( ZD ; ZD)2RkDkd .
We then allow models to capture dependencies between each domain representation and each tokenin dialogue context and current user utterance .
By segregating dialogue context and current utterance , our models can potentially detect changes of dialogue domains from past turns to the current turn .
Especially in multi - domain dialogues , users can switch from one domain to another and the next system response should address the latest domain .
We then obtain Zdst D;ctx= Att ( Zctx ; Zdst DD)2RkDkd andZdst D;utt= Att ( Zutt ; Zdst D;ctx)2RkDkdsequentially .
Similar to the slot - level module , we reﬁne feature representations over Ndst Dtimes and denote the ﬁnal output as Zdst D. Domain - Slot DST .
We combined domain and slot representations by expanding the tensors to identical dimensions i.e. kDkk Skd .
We then apply Hadamard product , resulting in domain - slot joint features Zdst DS2RkDkkSkd .
We then apply a self - attention layer to allow learning of dependencies between joint domain - slot features : Zdst= Att ( Zdst DS ; Zdst DS)2RkDkkSkd .
In this attention , we mask the intermediate representations in positions of invalid domain - slot pairs .
Compared to previous work such as ( Wu et al . , 2019a ) , we adopt a late fusion method whereby domain and slot representations are integrated in deeper layers .
3.2.1 State Generator The representations Zdstare used as context - aware representations to decode individual dialogue states .
Given a domain index iand slot index j , the feature vector Zdst[i ; j;:]2Rdis used to generate value of the corresponding ( domain , slot ) pair .
The vector is used as an initial hidden state for an RNN decoder to decode an inform slot value .
Given thek - th ( domain , slot ) pair and decoding step l , the output hidden state in each recurrent step hklis passed through a linear transformation with softmax to obtain output distribution over vocabulary set V : Pinf kl= Softmax ( hklWinf)2RkVk where Winf dst2RdrnnkVk .
For request slot of k - th ( domain , slot ) pair , we pass the corresponding vector Zdstvector through a linear layer with sigmoid activation to predict a value of 0 or 1 .
Preq k= Sigmoid ( Zdst kWreq ) .
Optimization .
The DST is optimized by the crossentropy loss functions of inform andrequest slots : Ldst = Linf+Lreq = kDSkX k=1kYkkX l=1 log(Pinf kl(ykl ) )
+ kDSkX k=1 yklog(Preq k) (1 yk)(1 log(Preq k ) )
18653.3 Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator ( DARG )
Database Representations .
Following ( Budzianowski et al . , 2018 ) , we create a one - hot vector for each domain d : xd db2f0;1g6 andP6 ixd db;i= 1 .
Each position of the vector indicates a number or a range of entities .
The vectors of all domains are concatenated to create a multi - domain vector Xdb2R6kDk .
We embed this vector as described in Section 3.1 .
Response Generation .
We adopt a stackedattention architecture that sequentially learns dependencies between each token in target responses with each dialogue component representation .
First , we obtain Zgen res= Att ( Zres ; Zres)2RLresd .
This attention layer can learn semantics within the target response to construct a more semantically structured sequence .
We then use attention to capture dependencies in background information contained in dialogue context and user utterance .
The outputs are Zgen ctx= Att ( Zctx ; Zgen res)2RLresdand Zgen utt= Att ( Zutt ; Zgen ctx)2RLresdsequentially .
To incorporate information of dialogue states and DB results , we apply attention steps to capture dependencies between each response token representation and state or DB representation .
Specifically , we ﬁrst obtain Zgen dst= Att ( Zdst ; Zgen utt)2 RLresd .
In the context - to - text setting , as we directly use the ground - truth dialogue states , we simply replace ZdstwithZcurr st .
Then we obtain Zgen db= Att ( Zdb ; Zgen dst)2RLresd .
These attention layers capture the information needed to generate tokens that are towards task completion and supplement the contextual cues obtained in previous attention layers .
We let the models to progressively capture these dependencies for Ngentimes and denote the ﬁnal output as Zgen .
The ﬁnal output is passed to a linear layer with softmax activation to decode system responses auto - regressively : Pres= Softmax ( ZgenWgen)2RLreskVresk Dialogue Act Modeling .
We couple response generation with dialogue act modeling by learning a latent variable Zact2Rd .
We place the vector in the ﬁrst position of Zres , resulting in Zres+act2R(Lres+1)d .
We then pass this tensor to the same stacked attention layers as above .
By adding the latent variable in the ﬁrst position , we allow our model to semantically condition all downstream tokens from second position , i.e. all tokens in the target response , on this latent variable .
The output representation of the latent vector i.e. Domain#dialogues train val test Restaurant 3,817 438 437 Hotel 3,387 416 394 Attraction 2,718 401 396 Train 3,117 484 495 Taxi 1,655 207 195 Police 245 0 0 Hospital 287 0 0 Table 2 : Summary of MultiWOZ dataset ( Budzianowski et al . , 2018 ) by domain ﬁrst row in Zgen , incorporates contextual signals accumulated from all attention layers and is used to predict dialogue acts .
We denote this representation as Zgen actand pass it through a linear layer to obtain a multi - hot encoded tensor .
We apply Sigmoid on this tensor to classify each dialogue act as 0 or 1 : Pact= Sigmoid ( Zgen actWact)2RkAk .
Optimization .
The response generator is jointly trained by the cross - entropy loss functions of generated responses and dialogue acts :
Lgen = Lres+Lact = kYreskX l=1 log(Pres l(yl ) )
+ kAkX a=1 yalog(Pact a) (1 ya)(1 log(Pact a ) ) 4 Experiments 4.1 Dataset We evaluate our models with the multi - domain dialogue corpus MultiWOZ 2.0 ( Budzianowski et al . , 2018 ) and 2.1 ( Eric et al . , 2019 ) ( The latter includes corrected state labels for the DST task ) .
From the dialogue state annotation of the training data , we identiﬁed all possible domains and slots .
We identiﬁedkDk= 7 domains andkSk= 30 slots , including 19 inform slots and 11 request slots .
We also identiﬁedkAk= 32 acts .
The corpus includes 8,438 dialogues in the training set and 1,000 in each validation and test set .
We present a summary of the dataset in Table 2 .

We adopt a teacher - forcing training strategy by simply using the ground - truth inputs of dialogue state of the previous turn and the gold DB representations .
During inference in DST and end - to - end tasks , we decode system responses sequentially turn by turn , using the previously decoded state as input in the current turn , and at each turn , using the new predicted state to query DBs .
We train all networks with Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) and a decaying learning rate schedule .
All models are trained up to 30epochs and the best models are selected based on validation loss .
We used a greedy approach to decode all slots and a beam search with beam size 5 .
To evaluate the models , we use the following metrics : Joint Accuracy and Slot Accuracy ( Henderson et al . , 2014b ) , Inform and Success ( Wen et al . , 2017 ) , and BLEU score ( Papineni et al . , 2002 ) .
As suggested by Liu et al . ( 2016 ) , human evaluation , even though popular in dialogue research , might not be necessary in tasks with domain constraints such as MultiWOZ .
We implemented all models using Pytorch and will release our code on github1 .
4.3 Results DST .
We test our state tracker ( i.e. using only Ldst ) and compare the performance with the baseline models in Table 3 ( Refer to Appendix B for description of DST baselines ) .
Our model can outperform ﬁxed - vocabulary approaches such as HJST and FJST , showing the advantage of generating unique slot values rather than relying on a slot ontology with a ﬁxed set of candidates .
DST Reader model ( Gao et al . , 2019 ) does not perform well and we note that many slot values are not easily expressed as a text span in source text inputs .
DST approaches that separate domain and slot representations such as TRADE ( Wu et al . , 2019a ) reveal 1https://github.com/henryhungle/ UniConvcompetitive performance .
However , our approach has better performance as we adopt a late fusion strategy to explicitly obtain more ﬁne - grained contextual dependencies in each domain and slot representation .
In this aspect , our model is related to TSCP ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) which decodes output state sequence auto - regressively .
However , TSCP attempts to learn domain and slot dependencies implicitly and the model is limited by selecting the maximum output state length ( which can vary signiﬁcantly in multi - domain dialogues ) .
Context - to - Text Generation .
We compare with existing baselines in Table 4 ( Refer to Appendix B for description of the baseline models ) .
Our model achieves very competitive Inform , Success , and BLEU scores .
Compared to TokenMOE ( Pei et al . , 2019 ) , our single model can outperform multiple domain - speciﬁc dialogue agents as each attention module can sufﬁciently learn contextual features of multiple domains .
Compared to HDSA ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) which uses a graph structure to representacts , our approach is simpler yet able to outperform HDSA in Inform score .
Our work is related to Structured Fusion ( Mehri et al . , 2019 ) as we incorporate intermediate representations during decoding .
However , our approach does not rely on pretraining individual sub - modules but simultaneously learning both act representations and predicting output tokens .
Similarly , our stacked attention architecture can achieve good performance in BLEU score , competitively with a GPT-2 based model ( Budzianowski and Vuli ´ c , 2019 ) , while consistently improve other metrics .
For completion , we tested our models on MultiWOZ2.1 and achieved similar results : 87.90 % Inform , 72.70 % Success , and 18.52 BLEU score .
Future work may further improve Success by optimizing the models towards a higher success rate using strategies such as LaRL ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) .
Another direction is a data augmentation approach such as DAMD ( Zhang et al . ,
1867Model Joint Acc Slot Acc Inform Success BLEU TSCP ( L=8 ) ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) 31.64 % 95.53 % 45.31 % 38.12 % 11.63 TSCP ( L=20 ) ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) 37.53 % 96.23 % 66.41 % 45.32 % 15.54 HRED - TS ( Peng et al . , 2019 ) - - 70.00 % 58.00 % 17.50 Structured Fusion ( Mehri et al . , 2019 ) - - 73.80 % 58.60 % 16.90 DAMD ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) - - 76.30 % 60.40 % 16.60 UniConv ( Ours ) 50.14 % 97.30 % 72.60 % 62.90 % 19.80 Table 5 : Evaluation on MultiWOZ2.1 in the end - to - end setting . 2019 ) which achieves signiﬁcant performance gain in this task .
End - to - End .
From Table 5 , our model outperforms existing baselines in all metrics except the Inform score ( See Appendix B for a description of baseline models ) .
In TSCP ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) , increasing the maximum dialogue state span Lfrom 8 to 20 tokens helps to improve the DST performance , but also increases the training time significantly .
Compared with HRED - TS ( Peng et al . , 2019 ) , our single model generates better responses in all domains without relying on multiple domainspeciﬁc teacher models .
We also noted that the performance of DST improves in contrast to the previous DST task .
This can be explained as additional supervision from system responses not only contributes to learn a natural response but also positively impact the DST component .
Other baseline models such as ( Eric and Manning , 2017 ; Wu et al . , 2019b ) present challenges in the MultiWOZ benchmark as the models could not fully optimize due to the large scale entity memory .
For example , following GLMP ( Wu et al . , 2019b ) , the restaurant domain alone has over 1,000 memory tuples of ( Subject , Relation , Object ) .
Ablation .
We conduct a comprehensive ablation analysis with several model variants in Table 6 and have the following observations : The model variant with a single - level DST ( by considering S = DSandNdst D= 0 ) ( Row A2 ) performs worse than the Bi - level DST ( Row A1 ) .
In addition , using the dual architecture also improves the latency in each attention layers as typically kDk+kSk  k DSk .
The performance gap also indicates the potential of separating global and local dialogue state dependencies by domain and slot level .
Using Bt 1and only the last user utterance as the dialogue context ( Row A1 and B1 ) performs as well as using Bt 1and a full - length dialogue history ( Row A5 and B3 ) .
This demonstrates that the information from thelast dialogue state is sufﬁcient to represent the dialogue history up to the last user utterance .
One beneﬁt from not using the full dialogue history is that it reduces the memory cost as the number of tokens in a full - length dialogue history is much larger than that of a dialogue state ( particularly as the conversation evolves over many turns ) .
We note that removing the loss function to learn the dialogue act latent variable ( Row B2 ) can hurt the generation performance , especially by the task completion metrics Inform andSuccess .
This is interesting as we expect dialogue acts affect the general semantics of output sentences , indicated by BLEU score , rather than the model ability to retrieve correct entities .
This reveals the beneﬁt of our approach .
By enforcing a semantic condition on each token of the target response , the model can facility the dialogue ﬂow towards successful task completion .
In both state tracker and response generator modules , we note that learning feature representations through deeper attention networks can improve the quality of predicted states and system responses .
This is consistent with our DST performance as compared to baseline models of shallow networks .
Lastly , in the end - to - end task , our model achieves better performance as the number of attention heads increases , by learning more high - resolution dependencies .
5 Domain - dependent Results DST .
For state tracking , the metrics are calculated for domain - speciﬁc slots of the corresponding domain at each dialogue turn .
We also report the DST separately for multi - domain and single - domain dialogues to evaluate the challenges in multi - domain dialogues and our DST performance gap as compared to single - domain dialogues .

our DST performs consistently well in the 3 domains attraction , restaurant , and train domains .
However , the performance drops in the taxiand hotel domain , signiﬁcantly in the taxidomain .
We note that dialogues with the taxidomain is usually not single - domain but typically entangled with other domains .
Secondly , we observe that there is a signiﬁcant performance gap of about 10 points absolute score between DST performances in singledomain and multi - domain dialogues .
State tracking in multi - domain dialogues is , hence , could be further improved to boost the overall performance .

Context - to - Text Generation For this task , we calculated the metrics for single - domain dialogues of the corresponding domain ( as Inform and Success are computed per dialogue rather than per turn ) .
We do not report the Inform metric of the taxidomain because no DB was available for this domain .
From Table 8 , we observe some performance gap between Inform andSuccess scores on multi - domain dialogues and single - domain dialogues .
However , in terms of BLEU score , our model performs better with multi - domain dialogues .
This could be caused by the data bias in MultiWOZ corpus as the majority of dialogues in this corpus is multidomain .
Hence , our models capture the semantics of multi - domain dialogue responses better than single - domain responses .
For domain - speciﬁc re - sults , we note that our models perform not as well as other domains in attraction andtaxidomains in terms of Success score .

Additionally , we report qualitative analysis and the insights can be seen in Appendix C. 6 Conclusion We proposed UniConv , a novel uniﬁed neural architecture of conversational agents for Multi - domain Task - oriented Dialogues , which jointly trains ( 1 ) a Bi - level State Tracker to capture dependencies in both domain and slot levels simultaneously , and ( 2 ) a Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator to model dialogue act latent variable and semantically conditions output responses with contextual cues .
The promising performance of UniConv on the MultiWOZ benchmark ( including three tasks : DST , context - to - text generation , and end - to - end dialogues ) validates the efﬁcacy of our method .

Multi - domain dialogue state tracking as dynamic knowledge graph enhanced question answering .
arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.06192 .
1872A Data Pre - processing First , we delexicalize each target system response sequence by replacing the matched entity attribute that appears in the sequence to the canonical tag hdomain _ sloti .
For example , the original target response ‘ the train i d is tr8259 departing from cambridge ’ is delexicalized into ‘ the train i d is train_id departing from train_departure ’ .
We use the provided entity databases ( DBs ) to match potential attributes in all target system responses .
To construct dialogue history , we keep the original version of all text , including system responses of previous turns , rather than the delexicalized form .
We split all sequences of dialogue history , user utterances of the current turn , dialogue states , and delexicalized target responses , into case - insensitive tokens .
We share the embedding weights of all source sequences , including dialogue history , user utterance , and dialogue states , but use a separate embedding matrix to encode the target system responses .
We summarize the number of dialogues in each domain in Table 2 .
For each domain , a dialogue is selected as long as the whole dialogue ( i.e. singledomain dialogue ) or parts of the dialogue ( i.e. in multi - domain dialogue ) is involved with the domain .
For each domain , we also build a set of possible inform andrequest slots using the dialogue state annotation in the training data .
The details of slots and database in each domain can be seen in Table 9 .
The DBs of 3 domains taxi , police , and hospital are not available as part of the benchmark .
On average , each dialogue has 1.8 domains and extends over 13 turns .
B Baselines We describe our baseline models in DST , contextto - text generation , and end - to - end dialogue tasks .
B.1 DST FJST andHJST ( Eric et al . , 2019 ) .
These models adopt a ﬁxed - vocabulary DST approach .
Both models include encoder modules ( either bidirectional LSTM or hierarchical LSTM ) to encode the dialogue history .
The models pass the context hidden states to separate linear transformation to obtain ﬁnal vectors to predict individual slots separately .
The output vector is used to measure a score of each candidate from a predeﬁned candidate set .
DST Reader ( Gao et al . , 2019 ) .
This model considers the DST task as a reading comprehension task and predicts each slot as a span over tokens withindialogue history .
DST Reader utilizes attentionbased neural networks with additional modules to predict slot type and carryover probability .
TSCP ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) .
The model adopts a sequence - to - sequence framework with a pointer network to generate dialogue states .
The source sequence is a combination of the last user utterance , dialogue state of the previous turn , and user utterance .
To compare with TSCP in a multi - domain task - oriented dialogue setting , we adapt the model to multi - domain dialogues by formulating the dialogue state of the previous turn similarly as our models .
We reported the performance when the maximum length of the output dialogue state sequence Lis set to 20 tokens ( original default parameter is 8 tokens but we expect longer dialogue state in MultiWOZ benchmark and selected 20 tokens ) .
HyST ( Goel et al . , 2019 ) .
This model combines the advantage of ﬁxed - vocabulary and openvocabulary approaches .
The model uses an openvocabulary approach in which the set of candidates of each slot is constructed based on all word ngrams in the dialogue history .
Both approaches are applied in all slots and depending on their performance in the validation set , the better approach is used to predict individual slots during test time .
TRADE ( Wu et al . , 2019a ) .
The model adopts a sequence - to - sequence framework with a pointer network to generate individual slot token - by - token .
The prediction is additionally supported by a slot gating component that decides whether the slot is “ none " , “ dontcare " , or “ generate " .
When the gate of a slot is predicted as “ generate " , the model will generate value as a natural output sequence for that slot .
NADST ( Le et al . , 2020 ) .
The model proposes a non - autoregressive approach for dialogue state tracking which enables learning dependencies between domain - level and slot - level representations as well as token - level representations of slot values .
DSTQA ( Zhou and Small , 2019 ) .
The model treats dialogue state tracking as a question answering problem in which state values can be predicted through lexical spans or unique generated values .
It is enhanced with a knowledge graph where each node represent a slot and edges are based on overlaps of their value sets .
SOM - DST ( Kim et al . , 2020 ) .
This is the current state - of - the - art model on the MultiWOZ2.1 dataset .
The model exploits a selectively overwriting mechanism on a ﬁxed - sized memory of dialogue states .

At each dialogue turn , the mechanism involve decision making on whether to update or carryover the state values from previous turns .
B.2 Context - to - Text Generation Baseline .
( Budzianowski et al . , 2018 ) provides a baseline for this setting by following the sequenceto - sequence model ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ) .
The source sequence is all past dialogue turns and the target sequence is the system response .
The initial hidden state of the RNN decoder is incorporated with additional signals from the dialogue states and database representations .
TokenMoE ( Pei et al . , 2019 ) .
TokenMoE refers to Token - level Mixture - of - Expert model .
The model follows a modularized approach by separating different components known as expert bots for different dialogue scenarios .
A dialogue scenario can be dependent on a domain , a type of dialogue act , etc .
A chair bot is responsible for controlling expert bots to dynamically generate dialogue responses .
HDSA ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) .
This is the current stateof - the - art in terms of Inform and BLEU score in the context - to - text generation setting in MultiWOZ2.0 .
HDSA leverages the structure of dialogue acts to build a multi - layer hierarchical graph .
The graph is incorporated as an inductive bias in a self - attention network to improve the semantic quality of generated dialogue responses .
Structured Fusion ( Mehri et al . , 2019 ) .
This approach follows a traditional modularized dialogue system architecture , including separate components for NLU , DM , and NLG .
These compo - nents are pre
- trained and combined into an end - toend system .
Each component output is used as a structured input to other components .
LaRL ( Zhao et
al . , 2019 ) .
This model uses a latent dialogue action framework instead of handcrafted dialogue acts .
The latent variables are learned using unsupervised learning with stochastic variational inference .
The model is trained in a reinforcement learning framework whereby the parameters are trained to yield a better Success rate .
The model is the current state - of - the - art in terms of Success metric .
GPT2 ( Budzianowski and Vuli ´ c , 2019 ) .
Unsupervised pre - training language models have signiﬁcantly improved machine learning performance in many NLP tasks .
This baseline model leverages the power of a pre - trained model ( Radford et al . , 2019 ) and adapts to the context - to - text generation setting in task - oriented dialogues .
All input components , including dialogue state and database state , are transformed into raw text format and concatenated as a single sequence .
The sequence is used as input to a pre - trained GPT-2 model which is then ﬁne - tuned with MultiWOZ data .
DAMD ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) .
This is the current state - of - the - art model for context - to - text generation task in MultiWOZ 2.1 .
This approach augments training data with multiple responses of similar context .
Each dialogue state is mapped to multiple valid dialogue acts to create additional state - act pairs .
1874B.3 End - to - End TSCP ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) .
In addition to the DST task , we evaluate TSCP as an end - to - end dialogue system that can do both DST and NLG .
We adapt the models to the multi - domain DST setting as described in Section B.1 and keep the original response decoder .
Similar to the DST component , the response generator of TSCP also adopts a pointer network to generate tokens of the target system responses by copying tokens from source sequences .
In this setting , we test TSCP with two settings of the maximum length of the output dialogue state sequence : L= 8andL= 20 .
HRED - TS ( Peng et
al . , 2019 ) .
This model adopts a teacher - student framework to address multidomain task - oriented dialogues .
Multiple teacher networks are trained for different domains and intermediate representations of dialogue acts and output responses are used to guide a universal student network .
The student network uses these representations to directly generate responses from dialogue context without predicting dialogue states .
C Qualitative Analysis We examine an example of dialogue in the test data and compare our predicted outputs with the baseline TSCP ( L= 20 ) ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) and the ground truth .
From Figure 4 , we observe that both our predicted dialogue state and system response are more correct than the baseline .
Speciﬁcally , our dialogue state can detect the correct type slot in theattraction domain .
As our dialogue state is correctly predicted , the queried results from DB is also more correct , resulting in better response with the right information ( i.e. ‘ no attraction available ’ ) .
In Figure 5 , we show the visualization of domain - level and slot - level attention on the user utterance .
We notice important tokens of the text sequences , i.e. ‘ entertainment ’ and ‘ close to ’ , are attended with higher attention scores .
Besides , at domain - level attention , we ﬁnd a potential additional signal from the token ‘ restaurant ’ , which is also the domain from the previous dialogue turn .
We also observe that attention is more reﬁned throughout the neural network layers .
For example , in the domain - level processing , compared to the 2ndlayer , the 4thlayer attention is more clustered around speciﬁc tokens of the user utterance .
In Table 10 and 11 , we reported the complete output of this example dialogue .
Overall , our dialogue agent can carry a proper dialogue with theuser throughout the dialogue steps .
Speciﬁcally , we observed that our model can detect new domains at dialogue steps where the domains are introduced e.g.attraction domain at the 5thturn and taxidomain at the 8thturn .
The dialogue agent can also detect some of the co - references among the domains .
For example , at the 5thturn , the dialogue agent can infer the slot area for the new domain attraction as the user mentioned ‘ close the restaurant ’ .
We noticed that that at later dialogue steps such as the 6thturn , our decoded dialogue state is not correct possibly due to the incorrect decoded dialogue state in the previous turn , i.e. 5thturn .
In Figure 2 and 3 , we plotted the Joint Goal Accuracy and BLEU metrics of our model by dialogue turn .
As we expected , the Joint Accuracy metric tends to decrease as the dialogue history extends over time .
The dialogue agent achieves the highest accuracy in state tracking at the 1stturn and gradually reduces to zero accuracy at later dialogue steps , i.e. 15thto18thturns .
For response generation performance , the trend of BLEU score is less obvious .
The dialogue agent obtains the highest BLEU scores at the 3rdturn and ﬂuctuates between the2ndand13thturn .
