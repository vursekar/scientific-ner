Abstract State - of - the - art neural machine translation methods employ massive amounts of parameters .
Drastically reducing computational costs of such methods without affecting performance has been up to this point unsuccessful .
To this end , we propose FullyQT : an allinclusive quantization strategy for the Transformer .
To the best of our knowledge , we are the ﬁrst to show that it is possible to avoid any loss in translation quality with a fully quantized Transformer .
Indeed , compared to fullprecision , our 8 - bit models score greater or equal BLEU on most tasks .
Comparing ourselves to all previously proposed methods , we achieve state - of - the - art quantization results .
1 Introduction The idea of using neural networks for machine translation was only recently proposed ( Kalchbrenner and Blunsom , 2013 ; Sutskever et al . , 2014 ; Cho et
al . , 2014 ) .
Nonetheless , the approach became the state - of - the - art in the ﬁeld ( Ahmed et al . , 2017 ; Ott et al . , 2018 ; Edunov et al . , 2018 ) .
A key element of this success was to allow the decoder to attend to all hidden states of the encoder ( Bahdanau et al . , 2014 ) .
A few variations to this additive attention mechanism have been proposed , such as multiplicative and self - attention ( Luong et al . , 2015 ;
Cheng et al . , 2016 ; Lin et al . , 2017 ) .
The latter formed the basis of the Transformer network ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) , which achieved state - of - the - art results in machine translation .
Inspiring a new wave of work , numerous natural language processing tasks reached new heights ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ) .
Unfortunately , these models use an enormous amount of parameters .
Inference on resource - limited hardware such as edge - devices is thus impractical .
A solution to reduce the computational burden of these networks is to lower numerical precision .
Consequently , numerical values can be representedusing fewer bits ( Tang and Kwan , 1993 ; Marchesi et al . , 1993 ) .
This method called quantization has the advantage of providing good compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy .
It is also conveniently supported by most hardware .
Properly quantizing the Transformer would allow computational speed gains at inference , as well as deployment on more constrained devices .
In this work , we propose a quantization - aware training strategy for the entire Transformer architecture .
Our method is easy to implement and results are consistent with the full - precision Transformer .
We test our approach on multiple translation tasks such as WMT14 EN - FR and WMT14 EN - DE and obtain state - of - the - art quantization results .
In comparison with full - precision , our quantized models score equal or higher BLEU on most tasks .
We are , to the best of our knowledge , the ﬁrst to show that the Transformer architecture can be fully quantized without impairing translation quality .
We also perform an ablation study and show that quantizing speciﬁc components of the Transformer improves BLEU score .
2 Background In this section , we review a broad spectrum of quantization and pruning methods for neural network compression .
2.1 Quantization Over the years , a large range of methods have been proposed to quantize neural networks .
These include , among many others , binary ( Courbariaux et al . , 2016 ) , ternary ( Lin et al . , 2015 ; Li et
al . , 2016 ) , uniform ( Jacob et al . , 2017 ) and learned ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) quantization .
These methods can be universally applied to any type of neural network .
To maintain performance though , speciﬁc architectures usually require custom tailored quantization schemes .
2Several recent work explore recurrent neural network ( Jordan , 1990 ) quantization .
Ott et al .
( 2016 ) propose an exponential quantization method for RNN weights .
They ﬁnd ternary and exponential quantization to work well on language modeling and speech recognition , while binary weights seemed ineffective .
Hubara et al .
( 2016 ) quantize weights and activations of both RNNs and LSTMs ( Hochreiter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ) to 2 , 4 and 6bit .
Meanwhile , He et al .
( 2016 ) propose modiﬁcations to the gates and interlinks of quantized LSTM and GRU ( Cho et al . , 2014 ) cells , as well as a balanced quantization method for weights .
Wu et al .
( 2016 ) successfully quantize a stacked sequence - tosequence LSTM to 8 - bit without any loss in translation quality .
Most recently , Wang et al .
( 2018 ) propose applying different quantization methods for different RNN components .
With regards to CNNs ( LeCun et al . , 1989 ) , various works have also explored quantizing these models .
Gong et
al .
( 2014 ) compare matrix factorization , binarization , k - means clustering , product quantization and residual quantization of CNNs .
Wu et al .
( 2015 ) apply quantization to both kernels and fully connected layers of convolutional neural networks .
Rastegari et
al .
( 2016 ) propose using binary weighted ﬁlters on AlexNet ( Krizhevsky et al . , 2012 ) .
Testing their method on ImageNet , they show classiﬁcation accuracy to be on par with fullprecision .
For faster inference and training , Zhou et al .
( 2016 ) use low bitwidth weights , activations and gradients on CNNs .
Quantization has been applied in tandem with other compression methods .
Han et al .
( 2015 ) combine pruning , quantization , weight sharing and Huffman coding .
In another line of work , Polino et al .
( 2018 ) employ quantization with knowledge distillation ( Hinton et al . , 2015 ) for higher compression rates .
Moreover , Chen et al .
( 2018 ) blend quantization with block based low - rank matrix approximation of embeddings .
2.2 Pruning The pruning of neural networks for model compression has also been largely explored .
LeCun et al .
( 1990 ) were the ﬁrst to propose a Hessian based method to prune neural net weights .
Hassibi et al .
( 1994 ) later improved the method .
More recently , See et al .
( 2016 ) show that pruning a fully trained model and then retraining it can increase performance over the original non - prunedmodel .
Gradually pruning in tandem with training has also been shown to increase performance ( Zhu and Gupta , 2017 ) .
To avoid sparse matrices , Liu et al .
( 2017 ) prune nodes instead of weights .
They apply a penalty in the loss on the  parameters of batch normalization layers .
With a similar objective , Narang et al . ( 2017b ) make better use of hardware by applying pruning and weight decay in blocks to minimize the number of loaded weight matrix chunks .
Similarly to quantization , pruning methods have also been adapted to speciﬁc architectures .
Liu et al .
( 2015 ) propose an efﬁcient sparse matrix multiplication algorithm for CNNs .
As for RNNs , Narang et al .
( 2017a ) show sparse pruning to work well on the architecture .
In order to maintain dimension consistency , Wen et al .
( 2017 ) propose to prune all basic LSTM structures concurrently .
Lastly , Park et al .
( 2018 ) introduce simple recurrent units ( SRUs ) for easy pruning of RNNs .
3 FullyQT 3.1 Quantization Methodology
Our quantization scheme was chosen to be uniform , meaning that the step size between two quantized values is constant .
This choice , which is an additional constraint , was made for practical reasons .
It indeed simpliﬁes all computations required during inference , enabling the exploitation of hardware resources more efﬁciently .
If the performance with uniform quantization is already on par with fullprecision , then more weighty methods are unnecessary .
A brief overview of uniform quantization is given in this section .
For more details , we refer the reader to Jacob et al .
( 2017 ) .
Given an element xof a tensor X , we apply the quantization function Q : Q(x )
= clamp ( x;xmin ; xmax) xmin s s+xmin ( 1 ) s = xmax xmin 2k 1(2 ) wherexminandxmax deﬁnes the endpoints of the quantization interval .
When quantization is applied to weights , these values are respectively min(X)andmax(X ) .
However , when quantization is applied to activations , those values are running estimates .
The latter are computed during training , where for every forward pass , the xmin andxmaxvariables are updated via an exponential moving average with a momentum of 0.9 .
The clamp function associates all values outside of the
3[xmin;xmax]range to the closest endpoint and be represents rounding to the nearest integer .
The valuekis simply the bit precision .
For example , in the context of 8 - bit quantization , k= 8 .
During backpropagation , we use the straightthrough estimator ( Hinton , 2012 ) and set the gradients of clamped values to zero .
Once training is ﬁnished , sandxminare frozen along with the weights .
3.2 What to Quantize We choose to quantize all operations which can provide a computational speed gain at inference .
In this regard , we quantize all matrix multiplications , meaning that the inputs and weights of MatMuls will both be k - bit quantized .
The other operations we quantize are divisions , but only if both the numerator and denominator are second or higher rank tensors .
For all other operations , such as sums , the computational cost added by the quantization operation outweighs the beneﬁt of performing the operation with reduced precision .
Hence , we do not quantize such operations .
More precisely , we quantize all weights of the Transformer , excluding biases .
The latter are summed with the INT32 output of matrix multiplications and thus provide no additional computational efﬁciency from being quantized .
Furthermore , the memory space of biases is insigniﬁcant in comparison to the weight matrices , representing less than 0.1 % of total weights .
For positional embeddings , these are ﬁxed and can thus be quantized once prior to training .
The  weights of LayerNorms are also quantized .
As for activations , we quantize the sum of the input embeddings with the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder .
In the Multi - Head Attention , we quantize the(Q;K;V ) input , the softmax ’s numerator , the softmax ’s denominator , the softmax ’s output and the Scaled Dot - Product Attention ’s output .
At inference , the softmax does not need to be computed in full - precision .
Indeed , the exponential function can instead be replaced with a step function .
For the position - wise feed - forward networks , we quantize the output of the ReLUs and of the feed - forwards themselves .
Finally , for all LayerNorms , we quantize the numerator x  , the denominatorp 2+ , their quotient and the output of the LayerNorm .
A visual guide is provided in appendix A.3.3 Bucketing Instead of using a single set of ( s;xmin)per quantized tensor , we can quantize subsets of the latter with each its own set of ( s;xmin)(Alistarh et al . , 2016 ) .
Even though this adds more scalars , the memory cost is insigniﬁcant overall .
Furthermore , the added ﬂexibility can greatly alleviate the precision loss resulting from all values being mapped to a single low numerical precision domain .
We use this bucketing method for all weight matrices , with a number of subset equal to the output dimension .
For activations , we use bucketing when quantizing : the sum of input embeddings with the positional encoding , the Q;K;V inputs , the Scaled Dot - Product Attention ’s output , the feed - forward ’s output , the LayerNorm ’s numerator , quotient and output .
3.4 Dealing with Zeros Unlike Jacob et al . ( 2017 ) , we do not nudge the domain so that the zero value gets perfectly mapped .
The only zero values which we have to deal with are the padding , the Softmax numerator and output , the output of ReLU layers and dropouts .
Since padding has no effect on the ﬁnal output , we completely ignore these values when quantizing .
For ReLUs and the Softmax ’s numerator and output , we ﬁx their xminto 0 , which guarantees the perfect mapping of the value .
Finally , quantization is applied before any dropout operation .
Indeed , even though the zeros added to the output of the quantization layer might not be part of the domain , this only happens during training .
4 Related Work Recently , simple quantization solutions have been applied to the Transformer .
Cheong and Daniel ( 2019 ) apply k - means quantization and binarization with two centroids over the weights of the network .
For both methods , a look up table associated with each quantized layer is used to map indices to their corresponding centroids .
Similarly , Fan ( 2019 ) compares binary , 4 and 8 - bit uniform quantization of the Transformer weights .
A big disadvantage with quantizing only the weights of a network is that operations must still be performed in full - precision .
Even though the parameters ’ memory usage is reduced , these constantly have to be converted back to full - precision .
Achieving quantization of both weights and activations is much more beneﬁcial .
The ﬁrst attempt at doing so for the
4Transformer applies 8 - bit quantization on weights and inputs of feed forward layers and binarizes the ( Q;K ) input of the Multi - Head Attention ( Tierno , 2019 ) .
The scaling factorpdkis approximated by a constant which can be computed as a right bitshift .
The method resulted in a huge drop in translation accuracy .
Achieving better performance , Bhandare et al .
( 2019 ) quantize certain MatMul operations and use the KL divergence to estimate the most suited parameters for each quantization range .
They restrain from quantizing all MatMuls , reporting poorer results in accuracy .
Aside from translation , the concurrent work by Zafrir et al .
( 2019 ) quantizes the embedding and fully connected layers of BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) .
The Softmax and LayerNorm operations are kept in full - precision .
On the GLUE benchmark , their loss in accuracy is minimal compared to the original model .
All of these methods omit quantizing the whole Transformer architecture , resulting in suboptimal computational efﬁciency .
Furthermore , these solutions all fail to avoid impairing translation quality .
Our method achieves both .
5 Experiments In this section , we present the results of our full quantization scheme on various tasks .
We ﬁrst compare our method on a machine translation setup .
Then we present the results of numerous ablation studies .
We also compare the impact of delaying quantization on translation quality .
Finally , we evaluate our method on two language model tasks and experiment with node pruning .
5.1 Full Quantization We apply our quantization strategy on both the base and big Transformer ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) .
The training setup of all presented models is the same as in the original paper , with the exception that the dropout ratio is set to 0.1 in all cases .
We refer readers to the original paper for experimental details .
Our models were ﬁrst evaluated on the WMT 2014 / 2017 English - toGerman and WMT 2014
English - to - French translation tasks .
Reported perplexity is per token and BLEU was measured with multi - bleu.pl1on thenewstest20142test set .
We used beam 1https://github.com/moses-smt/ mosesdecoder / blob / master / scripts/ generic / multi - bleu.perl 2https://www.statmt.org/wmt14/ translation-task.htmlsearch with a beam size of 4 and a length penalty of 0.6 .
Unlike Vaswani et al . ( 2017 ) , no checkpoint averaging was performed .
We compare our results with the original Transformer and other 8 - bit quantization methods in Table 1 .
All models are base Transformers .
Original uncompressed size is the same in all cases .
Most work do not report their compressed model size .
For those , we give lower bounds based on their reports .
Our BLEU score was computed on the test set using the checkpoint with the highest validation accuracy over 2 million training steps .
Validation was computed every training epoch .
Models were trained once .
Our objective was to train quantized models up to convergence .
Very similar BLEU scores can be obtained with much fewer training ( see below ) .
As for other methods , Cheong and Daniel ( 2019 ) retrain for 10k steps a 200k steps pretrained Transformer .
Fan ( 2019 ) also does the same but does not mention the number of retraining steps .
Bhandare et al .
( 2019 ) and the original Transformer paper both do not mention the number of training steps .
Out of all methods , we are the only one quantizing every component of the model ( see section 4 for details ) .
In Table 2 , we show performance of our method on the WMT14 EN - DE and WMT14 EN - FR for a ﬁxed amount of training steps .
We compare our results with two full - precision Transformers : base and big variants .
We also evaluate two other quantization approaches .
The ﬁrst one is the ” default ” approach , which is to naively quantize every possible operation .
The second approach applies our quantization strategy post - training ( see section 5.3 ) .
In all cases except for post - quantization , BLEU was computed on the test set using the checkpoint which scored the highest accuracy on the validation set .
Towards the end of training , we ran one validation epoch for every 100 training steps .
Baselines and FullyQT 8 - bit results were averaged over 5 trials .
Standard deviation of the BLEU scores did not seem higher for any method and ranged between 0.09 and 0.51 .
Training with quantization was about twice as slow as with the baselines .
As for post - training quantization , the BLEU score was computed on the test set using the best validation performance out of 20 trials .
The default approach ’s nan in the EN - FR task is due to numerical instability .
By quantizing every operation , zeros in the LayerNorm ’s denominator are more frequent .

Results on additional translation datasets can be found in Table 3 .
All models were trained following the same setup as WMT14 EN - FR and WMT14 EN - DE . V ocabulary size is set to 32k for all models .
Since there is no test set for WMT14 ES - EN , we used the validation set as a test set and omitted computing any validation epochs during training .
Looking at all conducted experiments , including section 5.3 , translation quality of the 8 - bit FullyQT models seems to be on par with full - precision .
Most of the time , the highest BLEU was scored by the quantized model .
For example in the case of WMT14 EN - DE , the maximum BLEU FullyQT base 8 - bit obtained was 26.98 , while the baseline’shighest was 26.64 .
As for the big models , the max FullyQT scored was 27.95 , whereas the baseline ’s was 27.43 .
We looked at training and validation curves to see if quantization had any effect , but saw no discernible difference .
All models use full - precision biases , sandxmin .
This amounts to 11.61 Mb in the base models and 23.15 Mb in the big models .
In the case of 8 - bit , these represent less than 2.35 % of the total size .
Without bucketing , this would amount to 2.18 Mb and 4.35 Mb respectively .
We believe the small increase in model size to be worth it .
Indeed , in section 5.2 , we show that training without bucketing leads to poorer translation .
6Although 6 - bit quantization seems to perform well , the compression advantage over 8 - bit is usually lost .
Most hardware store INT6 using either 8 or 32 bits .
Dedicated hardware is needed to get the full compression advantage .
Unless 6 - bit quantization results in better models , 8 - bit seems like the best choice for most hardware .
5.2 Ablation Studies To better understand which operations are more sensitive to quantization , we evaluate such effect on single operations of the Transformer .
By this , we mean quantizing the operation of a module for all Transformer layers .
Table 4 shows results on the WMT14 EN - FR translation task for 8 - bit precision .
The effect of bucketing was also evaluated .
BLEU was computed on the test set after 100k steps of training .
In 24 out of 27 experiments , performance was better than our full - precision baseline of 38.34 BLEU .
Solely quantizing the LayerNorm ’s denominator with no bucketing results in poor performance .
The latter also can not be bucketed since all dimensions of the variance tensor vary per batch .
To successfully quantize this element without causing any loss in performance , we suspect quantizing other elements in the network helps .
To further validate our quantization scheme , we evaluated four models trained with alterations to our design choices .
Results on the WMT14 EN - FR task are presented in Table 5 .
All models are 8 - bit quantized base Transformers .
Training procedure is the same as in section 5.1 .
5.3 Delaying Quantization Our method ’s goal is to increase computational efﬁciency when inferring with the Transformer .
To this end , our quantization scheme only requires us to learnsandxmin .
Although we do so throughout the whole training , this is not a necessity .
Quantization could also be applied later during training .
Results for different starting points are compared in Table 6 .
The earliest we start quantizing is at 100 steps , since we need at least a few steps to assess the running estimates .
All models were evaluated on the WMT14 EN - DE and WMT14 EN - FR translation tasks .
BLEU was measured on the test set using the checkpoint which scored the highest accuracy on the validation set during training .
Validation was computed every 100 training steps towards the end of training .
From our observed results , quantizing the model early on seems preferable .
Learning quantization parameters adds a signiﬁcant computational cost during training .
A major advantage to delaying quantization is to perform more training steps in the same given amount of time .
Therefore , when training time is a constraint , a possible strategy is to train a model without quantization , perform more training steps and ﬁnally post - quantize the model .
By the latter , we mean keeping all weights ﬁxed and compute the sand
xminover a few hundred steps .
This is another advantage , since many trials can be performed in search of the best performing candidate .
We found post - quantization BLEU scores to vary by about 0.2 BLEU .
5.4 Language Modeling To evaluate if our quantization scheme generalizes well to other tasks , we evaluate it on two language modeling datasets : WikiText-2 and WikiText-103 .
As the setup , we use PyTorch ’s language modeling toy example3 .
The task consists of predicting the sequencefxt+1;;xt+n+1gfrom the input sequencefxt;;xt+ng .
We trained four Transformer models , each with different precision .
All models consist of two Transformer encoder layers , with the embedding and hidden size set to 200 .
Multi - Head Attention has two heads with key and value size 64 .
The ﬁnal word projection layer ’s weights are shared with the embedding layer .
Models were trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 20 and sequence length of 35 .
Learning rate is set to 5 , dropout to 0.2 and gradient clipping to 0.25 .
Loss is computed on every element of the output sequence .
Results are presented in Table 7 .
Validation was computed every epoch to determine the best candidate .
Loss and perplexity are computed on the test set and averaged over 10 trials for WikiText-2 and 3 trials for WikiText-3 .
See footnote 3 for any extra details .
6 Pruning Useless Nodes We experiment with node pruning our Transformer models .
Once the model is fully trained and quantized , we can further compress it by removing useless nodes .
By useless , we mean nodes which do not cause any loss in translation quality when removed .
We choose to prune nodes instead of independently pruning weights .
The latter method usually requires special hardware or software to 3https://github.com/pytorch/examples/ tree / master / word_language_model

leverage sparse weight matrices .
Pruning nodes results in concretely shrunken models .
When getting rid of a node , we remove its corresponding set of weights from the layer outputting it and the following layer receiving the node as input .
The only nodes of the Transformer which can be removed without causing alterations to other components of the network are the nodes in between the two layers of each feed - forward network .
Fortunately , these consist of a substantial portion of the model ’s weights .
In the case of the base Transformer , for a respective vocabulary of size 37000 and 32000 , 39.96 % and 41.65 % of the total weights are owned by the feed - foward networks .
This number grows to 47.03 % and 48.18 % in the big Transformer .
To evaluate which nodes can be safely pruned without affecting translation quality , we estimate xmaxfor each node of the ReLU output over a few hundred steps .
This is done on the training set , using the fully trained model and keeping all other weights frozen .
These xmaxare computed before quantizing the ReLU output and do not replace the ones used by the quantization process .
Figure 3 in the appendix shows the histogram of these running estimates for one ReLU layer in the encoder and one in the decoder .
All other ReLU layers share the same pattern , where in the encoder there are always multiplexmaxclose to 0 .
This does not happen in the decoder .
Once the running estimates are computed , we prune its corresponding node if xmax < z where zis a hyperparameter and the standard deviation of the layer ’s xmax .
We empirically found z= 0:025to work well , with higher thresholds causing BLEU to quickly decay .
No retraining of the model is performed after pruning nodes .
Using this method , we can further compress the Transformer without affecting BLEU scores .
Our approach has the advantage of being adaptive ,

Total compression accounts for quantization combined with pruning .
meaning the number of nodes pruned per layer will differ as opposed to a ﬁxed pruning ratio method .
For example , in the case of the big Transformer trained on WMT14 EN - FR , 169 nodes were pruned in the ﬁrst ReLU of the encoder , while in the second , 1226 were pruned .
Nodes in the decoder rarely got pruned , at most 4 in the whole decoder .
Results are presented in Table 8 .
Reported results are averaged on the test set over a few trials .
BLEU varied by about 0.01 0.02 .
Other approaches usually decide the ratio ﬁrst and then prune .
We compared with two such methods .
For each task , we ﬁx their ratio to the average percentage of nodes pruned by our method and only prune nodes in the encoder .
The ﬁrst ﬁxed pruning method uses L1 - norm to sort nodes in ascending weight order , while the second sorts the xmax , also in ascending order .
7 Conclusion We proposed a full quantization strategy for the Transformer architecture .
Our objective was to ex - ploit hardware resources as efﬁciently as possible , quantizing all operations which could provide a computational speed gain .
With FullyQT , we achieve higher BLEU scores than all other quantization methods for the Transformer on multiple translation tasks and avoid any loss in BLEU compared to full - precision .
Specifically , out of 35 experiments , 8 - bit quantization performed better than full - precision in 21 cases .
If instead of minimizing inference time , one wants to maximize translation accuracy , then applying quantization to only certain components of the Transformer seems to be the best option .
Indeed , our ablation study showed than BLEU score could increase even more when only speciﬁc elements of the Transformer were quantized .
Further gains might be possible , but supplementary experiments would be necessary to determine the best combination .
We plan on extending our work to variations of the Transformer , as well as further exploring the compression of these networks .
