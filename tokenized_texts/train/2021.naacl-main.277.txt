Current simpliﬁcation systems are predominantly sequence - to - sequence models that are trained end - to - end to perform all these operations simultaneously .
However , such systems limit themselves to mostly deleting words and can not easily adapt to the requirements of different target audiences .
In this paper , we propose a novel hybrid approach that leverages linguistically - motivated rules for splitting and deletion , and couples them with a neural paraphrasing model to produce varied rewriting styles .
We introduce a new data augmentation method to improve the paraphrasing capability of our model .
Through automatic and manual evaluations , we show that our proposed model establishes a new state - ofthe art for the task , paraphrasing more often than the existing systems , and can control the degree of each simpliﬁcation operation applied to the input texts.1 1 Introduction Text Simpliﬁcation aims to improve the readability of texts with simpler grammar and word choices while preserving meaning ( Saggion , 2017 ) .
It provides reading assistance to children ( Kajiwara et al . , 2013 ) , non - native speakers ( Petersen and Ostendorf , 2007 ; Pellow and Eskenazi , 2014 ; Paetzold , 2016 ) , and people with reading disabilities ( Rello et al . , 2013 ) .
It also helps with downstream natural language processing tasks , such as parsing ( Chandrasekar et al . , 1996 ) , semantic role labelling ( Vickrey and Koller , 2008 ) , information extraction ( Miwa et al . , 2010 ) , and machine translation ( MT , Chen et al . , 2012 ; Štajner and Popovic , 2016 ) .
Since 2016 , nearly all text simpliﬁcation systems have been sequence - to - sequence ( seq2seq ) 1Our code and data are available at https://github . com / mounicam / controllable_simplification .OLen

Existing systems rely on deletion and do not paraphrase well .

models trained end - to - end , which have greatly increased the ﬂuency of the outputs ( Zhang and Lapata , 2017 ; Nisioi et al . , 2017 ; Zhao et
al . , 2018 ; Kriz et al . , 2019 ; Dong et al . , 2019 ; Jiang et al . , 2020 ) .
However , these systems mostly rely on deletion and tend to generate very short outputs at the cost of meaning preservation ( Alva - Manchego et al . , 2017 ) .
Table 1 shows that they neither split sentences nor paraphrase well as reﬂected by the low percentage of splits ( < 1 % ) and new words introduced ( < 11.2 % ) .
While deleting words is a viable ( and the simplest ) way to reduce the complexity of sentences , it is suboptimal and unsatisfying .
Professional editors are known to use a sophisticated combination of deletion , paraphrasing , and sentence splitting to simplify texts ( Xu et
al . , 2015 ) .
Another drawback of these end - to - end neural systems is the lack of controllability .
Simpliﬁcation is highly audience dependant , and what constitutes simpliﬁed text for one group of users may not be acceptable for other groups ( Xu et
al . , 2015 ; Lee and Yeung , 2018 ) .
An ideal simpliﬁcation system should be able to generate text with varied characteristics , such as different lengths , readability levels , and number of split sentences , which can be difﬁcult to control in end - to - end systems .
3537 Figure 1 : Overview of our proposed model for text simpliﬁcation , which can perform a controlled combination of sentence splitting , deletion , and paraphrasing .
To address these issues , we propose a novel hybrid approach that combines linguisticallymotivated syntactic rules with data - driven neural models to improve the diversity and controllability of the simpliﬁcations .
We hypothesize that the seq2seq generation model will learn lexical and structural paraphrases more efﬁciently from the parallel corpus , when we ofﬂoad some of the burden of sentence splitting ( e.g. , split at comma ) and deletion ( e.g. , remove trailing preposition phrases ) decisions to a separate component .
Previous hybrid approaches for simpliﬁcation ( Narayan and Gardent , 2014 ; Siddharthan and Mandya , 2014 ; Sulem et al . , 2018c ) used splitting and deletion rules in a deterministic step before applying an MT - based paraphrasing model .
In contrast , our approach provides a more ﬂexible and dynamic integration of linguistic rules with the neural models through ranking and data augmentation ( Figure 1 ) .
We compare our method to several state - of - theart systems in both automatic and human evaluations .
Our model achieves overall better performance measured by SARI ( Xu et al . , 2016 ) and other metrics , showing that the generated outputs are more similar to those written by human editors .
We also demonstrate that our model can control the extent of each simpliﬁcation operation by : ( 1 ) imposing a soft constraint on the percentage of words to be copied from the input in the seq2seq model , thus limiting lexical paraphrasing ; and ( 2 ) selecting candidates that underwent a desired amount of splitting and/or deletion .
Finally , we create a new test dataset with multiple human references for Newsela ( Xu et
al . , 2015 ) , the widely used text simpliﬁcation corpus , to speciﬁcally evaluate lexical paraphrasing.2 Our Approach Figure 1 shows an overview of our hybrid approach .
We combine linguistic rules with data - driven neural models to improve the controllability and diversity of the outputs .
Given an input complex sentence x , we ﬁrst generate a set of intermediate simpliﬁcationsV = fv1;v2;:::;vngthat have undergone splitting and deletion ( § 2.1 ) .
These intermediate sentences are then used for two purposes : ( 1 ) Selected by a pairwise neural ranking model ( § 2.2 ) based on the simpliﬁcation quality and then rewritten by the paraphrasing component ; ( 2 ) Used for data augmentation to improve the diversity of the paraphrasing model ( § 2.3 ) .
2.1 Splitting and Deletion We leverage the state - of - the - art system for structural simpliﬁcation , called DisSim ( Niklaus et al . , 2019 ) , to generate candidate simpliﬁcations that focus on splitting and deletion.2The English version of DisSim applies 35 hand - crafted grammar rules to break down a complex sentence into a set of hierarchically organized sub - sentences ( see Figure 1 for an example ) .
We choose a rule - based approach for sentence splitting because it works really well .
In our pilot experiments , DisSim successfully split 92 % of 100 complex sentences from the training data with more than 20 words , and introduced errors for only 6.8 % of these splits .
We consider these sub - sentences as candidate simpliﬁcations for the later steps , except those that are extremely short or long ( compression ratio = 2[0.5 , 1.5 ] ) .
The compression ratio is calculated as the number of 2https://github.com/Lambda-3/ DiscourseSimplification
3538words in a candidate simpliﬁcation vi(which may contain one or more sub - sentences ) divided by that of the original sentence x.
To further increase the variety of generated candidates , we supplement DisSim with a Neural Deletion and Split module trained on the text simpliﬁcation corpus ( § 3.1 ) .
We use a Transformer seq2seq model with the same conﬁguration as the base model for paraphrasing ( § 2.3 ) .
Given the input sentence x , we constrain the beam search to generate 10 outputs with splitting and another 10 outputs without splitting .
Then , we select the outputs that do not deviate substantially from x(i.e . , Jaccard similarity > 0.5 ) .
We add outputs from the two systems to the candidate pool V. 2.2 Candidate Ranking
We design a neural ranking model to score all the candidates that underwent splitting and deletion , V = fv1;v2;:::;vng , then feed the top - ranked one to the lexical paraphrasing model for the ﬁnal output .
We train the model on a standard text simpliﬁcation corpus consisting of pairs of complex sentence xand manually simpliﬁed reference y. Scoring Function .
To assess the “ goodness ” of each candidate viduring training , we deﬁne the gold scoring function gas a length - penalized BERTscore : g(vi;y )
= e jj  vi   yjj BERTScore ( vi;y)(1 ) BERTScore ( Zhang et al . , 2020b ) is a text similarity metric that uses BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) embeddings to ﬁnd soft matches between word pieces ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) instead of exact string matching .
We introduce a length penalty to favor the candidates that are of similar length to the human reference yand penalize those that deviate from the target compression ratio  y.deﬁnes the extent of penalization and is set to 1 in our experiments . 
vi represents the compression ratios of vicompared to the input x.
In principle , other similarity metrics can also be used for scoring .
Pairwise Ranking Model .
We train the ranking model in a pairwise setup since BERTScore is sensitive to the relative rather than absolute similarity , when comparing multiple candidates with the same reference .
We transform the gold ranking of V ( jVj = n ) inton2pairwise comparisons for everycandidate pair , and learn to minimize the pairwise ranking violations using hinge loss : LMR=1 mmX k=11 n2 knkX i=1nkX j=1;i6 = jmax(0;1 lk ijdk ij ) dk ij = g(vk i) g(vk j ) lk
ij = sign g(vk i;yk) g(vk j;yk) ( 2 ) whereg(:)is a feedforward neural network , mis the number of training complex - simple sentence pairs , kis the index of training examples , and nkrepresents the number of generated candidates ( § 2.1 ) .
On average , nkis about 14.5 for a sentence of 30 words , and can be larger for longer sentences .
We consider 10 randomly sampled candidates for each complex sentence during training .
Features .
For the feedforward network g (: ) , we use the following features : number of words in viandx , compression ratio of viwith respect to x , Jaccard similarity between viandx , the rules applied on xto obtain vi , and the number of rule applications .
We vectorize all the real - valued features using Gaussian binning ( Maddela and Xu , 2018 ) , which has shown to help neural models trained on numerical features ( Liu et al . , 2016 ; Sil et al . , 2017 ; Zhong et al . , 2020 ) .
We concatenate these vectors before feeding them to the ranking model .
We score each candidate viseparately and rank them in the decreasing order of g(vi ) .
We provide implementation details in Appendix A. 2.3 Paraphrase Generation
We then paraphrase the top - ranked candidate ^v2
Vto generate the ﬁnal simpliﬁcation output ^ y. Our paraphrase generation model can explicitly control the extent of lexical paraphrasing by specifying the percentage of words to be copied from the input sentence as a soft constraint .
We also introduce a data augmentation method to encourage our model to generate more diverse outputs .
Base Model .
Our base generation model is a Transformer encoder - decoder initialized by the BERT checkpoint ( ? ) , which achieved the best reported performance on text simpliﬁcation in the recent work ( Jiang et al . , 2020 ) .
We enhance this model with an attention - based copy mechanism to encourage lexical paraphrasing , while remaining faithful to the input .
3539Copy Control .
Given the input candidate ^v=
( ^v1;^v2 ; : : : ; ^vl)oflwords and the percentage of copyingcp2(0;1 ] , our goal is to paraphrase the rest of ( 1 cp)lwords in ^vto a simpler version .
To achieve this , we convert cpinto a vector of the same dimension as BERT embeddings using Gaussian binning ( Maddela and Xu , 2018 ) and add it to the beginning of the input sequence ^v .
The Transformer encoder then produces a sequence of context - aware hidden states H= ( h1;h2:::hl ) , where hicorresponds to the hidden state of ^vi .
Eachhiis fed into the copy network which predicts the probability pithat word ^vishould be copied to output .
We create a new hidden state hiby adding hito a vector uscaled according to pi .
In other words , the scaled version of uinforms the decoder whether the word should be copied .
A single vectoruis used across all sentences and hidden states , and is randomly initialized then updated during training .
More formally , the encoding process can be described as follows : ( h1;h2;:::;hl ) = encoder ( [ cp ; ^v1;^v2 ; : : : ; ^vl ] ) hi = hi+piu ; H= ( h1;h2 ; : : : ; hl ) ( 3 ) The Transformer decoder generates the output sequence from H. Our copy mechanism is incorporated into the encoder rather than copying the input words during the decoding steps ( Gu et al . , 2016 ; See et al . , 2017 ) .
Unless otherwise speciﬁed , we use the average copy ratio of the training dataset , 0.7 , for our experiments .
Multi - task Training .
We train the paraphrasing model and the copy network in a multi - task learning setup , where predicting whether a word should be copied serves as an auxiliary task .
The gold labels for this task are obtained by checking if each word in the input sentence also appears in the human reference .
When a word occurs multiple times in the input , we rely on the monolingual word alignment results from JacanaAlign ( Yao et al . , 2013 ) to determine which occurrence is the one that gets copied .
We train the Transformer model and the copy network jointly by minimizing the cross - entropy loss for both decoder generation and binary word classiﬁcation .
We provide implementation and training details in Appendix A. Data Augmentation .
The sentence pairs in the training corpus often exhibit a variable mix of splitting and deletion operations along with paraphras - ing ( see Figure 1 for an example ) , which makes it difﬁcult for the encoder - decoder models to learn paraphrases .
Utilizing DisSim , we create additional training data that focuses on lexical paraphrasing For each sentence pair hx;yi , we ﬁrst generate a set of candidates V = fv1;v2;:::;vngby applying DisSim to x , as described in § 2.1 .
Then , we select a a subset of V , calledV0 = fv0 1;v0 2;:::;v0 n0 g ( V02V ) that are fairly close to the reference y , but have only undergone splitting and deletion .
We score each candidate viusing the length - penalized BERTScore g(vi;y)in Eq .
( 1 ) , and discard those with scores lower than 0.5 .
While calculating g , we set  yandto 1 and 2 respectively to favor candidates of similar length to the reference y. We also discard the candidates that have different number of split sentences with respect to the reference .
Finally , we train our model on the ﬁltered candidate - reference sentence pairs hv0 1;yi , hv0 2;yi , : : : , hv0 n0;yi , which focus on lexical paraphrasing , in addition tohx;yi . 2.4 Controllable Generation We can control our model to concentrate on speciﬁc operations .
For split- or delete - focused simpliﬁcation , we select candidates with desirable length or number of splits during the candidate generation step .
We perform only the paraphrase generation step for paraphrase - focused simpliﬁcation .
The paraphrasing model is designed speciﬁcally to paraphrase with minimal deletion and without splitting .
It retains the length and the number of split sentences in the output , thus preserving the extent of deletion and splitting controlled in the previous steps .
We control the degree of paraphrasing by changing the copy ratio .
3 Experiments In this section , we compare our approach to various sentence simpliﬁcation models using both automatic and manual evaluations .
We show that our model achieves a new state - of - the - art and can adapt easily to different simpliﬁcation styles , such as paraphrasing and splitting without deletion .
3.1 Data and Experiment Setup We train and evaluate our models on Newsela ( Xu et al . , 2015)3and Wikipedia copora ( Zhu et al . , 2010 ; Woodsend and Lapata , 2011 ; Coster and Kauchak , 2011 ) .

We also report FKGL ( FK ) , average sentence length ( SLen ) , output length ( OLen ) , compression ratio ( CR ) , self - BLEU ( s - BL ) , percentage of sentence splits ( % split ) , average percentage of new words added to the output ( % new ) , and percentage of sentences identical to the input ( % eq ) .Bold

articles with each article rewritten by professional editors for students in different grades .
We used the complex - simple sentence pairs automatically aligned by Jiang et al .
( 2020 ) , called the NEWSELA AUTO dataset .
To capture sentence splitting , we joined the adjacent sentences in the simple article that are aligned to the same sentence in the complex article .
Following Štajner
et
al . ( 2015 ) , we removed the sentence pairs with high ( > 0.9 ) and low ( < 0.1 ) BLEU ( Papineni et
al . , 2002 ) scores , which mostly correspond to the near identical and semantically divergent sentence pairs respectively .
The ﬁnal dataset consists of 259,778 train , 32,689 validation and 33,391 test complex - simple sentence pairs , where30 % of pairs involve sentence splitting .
Besides Newsela , we also provide the details of experiments on Wikipedia corpus in Appendix F , which show similar trends .
To demonstrate that our model can be controlled to generate diverse simpliﬁcations , we evaluate under the following settings : ( i ) Standard evaluation on the NEWSELA -AUTO test set similar to the methodology in the recent literature ( Jiang et al . , 2020 ;
Dong et al . , 2019 ; Zhang and Lapata , 2017 ) , and ( ii ) Evaluation on different subsets of the NEWSELA -AUTO test set that concentrate on a speciﬁc operation .
We selected 9,356 sentence pairs with sentence splits for split - focused evaluation .
Similarly , we chose 9,511 sentence pairs with compression ratio < 0.7 and without sentences splits to evaluate delete - focused simpliﬁcation .
We created a new dataset , called NEWSELA TURK , to evaluate lexical paraphrasing.4Similar to the WIKIPEDIA -TURK benchmark corpus ( Xu et al . , 2016 ) , NEWSELA -TURK consists of human - written references focused on lexical para4We also provide results on 8,371 sentence pairs of NEWSELA -AUTO test set with compression ratio > 0.9 and no splits in Appendix D , which show similar trends.phrasing .
We ﬁrst selected sentence pairs from the NEWSELA -AUTO test set of roughly similar length ( compression ratio between 0.8 and 1.2 ) and no sentence splits because they more likely involve paraphrasing .
Then , we asked Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to simplify the complex sentence without any loss in meaning.5To ensure the quality of simpliﬁcations , we manually selected the workers using the qualiﬁcation test proposed in AlvaManchego et al .
( 2020 ) , during which the workers were asked to simplify three sentences .
We selected top 35 % of the 300 workers that participated in the test .
We periodically checked the submissions and removed the bad workers .
In the end , we collected 500 sentences with 4 references for each sentence .
3.2 Existing Methods We use the following simpliﬁcation approaches as baselines : ( i ) BERT - Initialized Transfomer ( ? ) , where the encoder is initialized with BERT base checkpoint and the decoder is randomly initialized .
It is the current state - of - the - art for text simpliﬁcation ( Jiang et al . , 2020 ) .
( ii ) EditNTS ( Dong et al . , 2019),6another state - of - the - art model that uses a neural programmer - interpreter ( Reed and de Freitas , 2016 ) to predict the edit operation on each word , and then generates the simpliﬁed sentence .
( iii ) LSTM baseline , a vanilla encoderdecoder model used in Zhang and Lapata ( 2017 ) .
( iv)Hybrid - NG ( Narayan and Gardent , 2014),7 one of the best existing hybrid systems that performs splitting and deletion using a probabilistic model and lexical substitution with a phrase - based machine translation system .
We retrained all the models on the N EWSLA -AUTO dataset .

3.3 Automatic Evaluation Metrics .
We report SARI ( Xu et al . , 2016 ) , which averages the F1 / precision of n - grams ( n2 f1;2;3;4g)inserted , deleted and kept when compared to human references .
More speciﬁcally , it computes the F1 score for the n - grams that are added ( add),8which is an important indicator if a model is good at paraphrasing .
The model ’s deletion capability is measured by the F1 score for n - grams that are kept ( keep ) and precision for those deleted ( del).9To evaluate a model ’s para8We slightly improved the SARI implementation by Xu
et al .
( 2016 ) to exclude the spurious ngrams while calculating the F1 score for add .
For example , if the input contains the phrase “ is very beautiful ” , the phrase “ is beautiful ” is treated as a new phrase in the original implementation even though it is caused by the delete operation .
9SARI score of a reference with itself may not always be 100 as it considers 0 divided by 0 as 0 , instead of 1 , when calculating n - gram precision and recall .
This avoids the inﬂation ofdelscores when the input is same as the output.phrasing capability and diversity , we calculate the BLEU score with respect to the input ( s - BL ) , the percentage of new words ( % new ) added , and the percentage of system outputs identical to the input ( % eq ) .
Low s - BL , % eq , or high % new indicate that the system is less conservative .
We also report Flesch - Kincaid ( FK ) grade level readability ( Kincaid and Chissom , 1975 ) , average sentence length ( SLen ) , the percentage of splits ( % split ) , compression ratio ( CR ) , and average output length ( OLen ) .
We do not report BLEU because it often does not correlate with simplicity ( Sulem et al . , 2018a , b ; Xu et
al . , 2016 ) .

deletion as they show high self - BLEU ( > 66.5 ) and FK ( > 8.8 ) scores despite having compression ratios similar to other systems .
Transformer model alone is rather conservative and copies 10.2 % of the sentences directly to the output .
Although HybridNG makes more changes than any other baselines , its SARI and add scores are 3.7 and 1.7 points lower than our model indicating that it generates more errors .
Our model achieves the lowest self - BLEU ( 48.7 ) , FK ( 7.9 ) , and percentage of sentences identical to the input ( 0.4 ) , and the highest add ( 3.3 ) score and percentage of new words ( 16.2 % ) .
In other words , our system is the least conservative , generates more good paraphrases , and mimics the human references better .
We provide examples of system outputs in Table 9 and Appendix C. Tables 3 , 4 , and 5 show the results on NEWSELA TURK , split - focused , and delete - focused subsets of NEWSELA -AUTO test set respectively .
For these experiments , we conﬁgure our model to focus on speciﬁc operations ( details in § 2.4 ) .
Our model again outperforms the existing systems according to SARI , add score , and percentage of new words , which means that our model is performing more meaningful paraphrasing .
We show that we can control the extent of paraphrasing by varying the copy ratio ( cp ) .
Our model splits 93.5 % of the sentences , which is substantially better than the other models .
3.4 Human Evaluation We performed two human evaluations : one to measure the overall simpliﬁcation quality and the other to speciﬁcally capture sentence splitting.11For the ﬁrst one , we asked ﬁve Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to evaluate ﬂuency , adequacy and simplicity of 100 random simpliﬁcations from the NEWSELA -AUTO test set .
We supplemented the 2 - 3 readability levels in NEWSELA -AUTO , which contained more lexical overlaps and inﬂated the scores for EditNTS .
11We provide instructions in Appendix E.ﬂuency and adequacy ratings with binary questions described in Zhang
et al .
( 2020a ) for the second evaluation over another 100 simpliﬁcations from theNEWSELA -AUTO split - focused test set .
We asked if the output sentence exhibits spitting and if the splitting occurs at the correct place .
While ﬂuency measures the grammaticality of the output , adequacy captures the extent of meaning preserved when compared to the input .
Simplicity evaluates if the output is simpler than the input .
Each sentence was rated on a 5 - point Likert scale and we averaged the ratings from the ﬁve workers .
We chose the majority value for the binary ratings .
We used the output of our model that is tailored for sentence splitting for the second evaluation .
Table 6 demonstrates that our model achieves the best ﬂuency , simplicity , and overall ratings .
The adequacy rating is also very close to that of Transformer bertand EditNTS even though our model is performing more paraphrasing ( Table 2 ) , which veriﬁes that the changes made by our system are meaningful .
Our model achieves the most number of correct sentence splits ( 90 % ) , and the highest ﬂuency ( 4.19 ) for syntactic simpliﬁcation , showing that it can generate more number of coherent sentence splits when compared to other models .
4 Model Analysis In this section , we analyze the contribution of each model component and examine the system errors .
4.1 System Ablations We evaluate our key design choices , namely candidate ranking that is based on length - penalized BERTScore and paraphrase generation that uses data augmentation and copy attention .
Table 8 summarizes the results .
Our pairwise ranking model ( BERTScore len ) achieves an increase of 3.2 points in SARI when compared to choosing a random ( Random ) candidate .
Randomly selecting a candidate also performs fairly well , indicating that the

Compared to our ﬁnal model ( Our Model ) , its variants without data augmentation (  augmentation ) and copy mechanism (  copy attn ) suffer a drop of 1.0 and 2.6 points in SARI respectively and a decrease of at least 3.0 % of new words , which demonstrates that these components encourage the system to paraphrase .
Our model trained on only DisSim (  only DisSim ) and Transformer (  only Transformer ) candidates performs close to our best model ( Our Model ) in terms of SARI .
4.2 Error Analysis To understand the errors generated by our model , we manually classiﬁed 200 simpliﬁcations from theNEWSELA -AUTO test set into the following categories : ( a ) Good , where the model generated meaningful simpliﬁcations , ( b ) Hallucinations , where the model introduced information not in the input , ( c)Fluency Errors , where the model generated ungrammatical output , ( d ) Anaphora Resolution , where it was difﬁcult to resolve pronouns in the output .
( e ) Bad substitution , where the model inserted an incorrect simpler phrase , and ( e ) Human Reference Errors , where the reference does not reﬂect the source sentence .
Note that a simpliﬁcation can belong to multiple error categories .
Table 7 shows the examples of each category .
5 Related Work Before the advent of neural networks , text simpliﬁcation approaches performed each operation separately in a pipeline manner using either handcrafted rules ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Siddharthan , 2002 ; Siddharthan et al . , 2004 ) or data - driven methods based on parallel corpora ( Zhu et al . , 2010 ; Woodsend and Lapata , 2011 ; Narayan and Gardent , 2014 ) .
Following neural machine translation , the trend changed to performing all the operations together end - toend ( Zhang and Lapata , 2017 ; Nisioi et al . , 2017 ; Zhao et al . , 2018 ; Alva - Manchego et al . , 2017 ; Vu

al . , 2018 ; Kriz et al . , 2019 ; Dong et al . , 2019 ; Jiang et al . , 2020 ) at the cost of controllability and performance as shown in this paper .
Controllable text simpliﬁcation has been attempted before , but only with limited capability .
Scarton and Specia ( 2018 ) and Martin et al . ( 2020 ) added additional tokens to the input representing grade level , length , lexical , and structural complexity constraints .
Nishihara et al .
( 2019 ) proposed a loss which controls word complexity , while Mallinson and Lapata ( 2019 ) concatenated constraints to each word embedding .
Kumar et al .
( 2020 ) proposed a linguistic scoring function to control the edits to the input .
Another long body of research focuses on a single simpliﬁcation operation and can be broadly divided into three categories : ( 1 ) Lexical Simpliﬁcation ( Specia et al . , 2012 ;
Horn et al . , 2014 ; Glavaš and Štajner , 2015 ; Paetzold and Specia , 2017 , 2015 ; Maddela and Xu , 2018 ; Qiang et al . , 2020 ) , where complex words are substituted with simpler words .
( 2 ) Syntactic Simpliﬁcation ( Siddharthan , 2006 ; Aharoni and Goldberg , 2018 ; Botha et al . , 2018 ; Niklaus et al . , 2019 ) , which deals exclusively with sentence splitting , and ( 3 ) Sentence Compression ( Filippova et al . , 2015 ; Rush et al . , 2015 ; Nallapati et al . , 2016 ; See et al . , 2017 ; Baziotis et al . , 2019 ) , where the goal is to shorten the input sentence by removing its irrelevant content.6 Conclusion We proposed a novel hybrid approach for sentence simpliﬁcation that performs better and produces more diverse outputs than the existing systems .
We designed a new data augmentation method to encourage the model to paraphrase .
We created a new dataset , NEWSELA -TURK , to evaluate paraphrasing - focused simpliﬁcations .
We showed that our model can control various attributes of the simpliﬁed text , such as number of sentence splits , length , and number of words copied from the input .

A monolingual tree - based translation model for sentence simpliﬁcation .
In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics .
3549A Implementation and Training Details We implemented two separate Transformer models for neural deletion and split component ( § 2.1 ) and paraphrase generation ( § 2.3 ) using the Fairseq12 toolkit .
Both the encoder and decoder follow BERTbase13architecture , while the encoder is also initialized with BERT base checkpoint .
For neural deletion and split component , we used a beam search of width 10 to generate candidates .
The copy attention mechanism is a feedforward network containing 3 hidden layers , 1000 nodes in each layer with tanh activation , and a single linear output node with sigmoid activation .
We used Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) with a learning rate of 0.0001 , linear learning rate warmup of 40k steps , and 100k training steps .
We used a batch size of 64 .
We used BERT WordPiece tokenizer .
During inference , we constrained the beam - search to not repeat trigrams and emitted sentences that avoided aggressive deletion ( compression ratio 2[0:9;1:2 ] .
We chose the best checkpoint based on the SARI score ( Xu et al . , 2016 ) on the dev set .
We saved a checkpoint after every epoch .
We did not perform any hyperparameter search and directly used the hyperparameters of the BERT - initialized Transformer described in ? .
The model takes 10 hours to train on 1 NVIDIA GeForce GPU .
Our pairwise ranking model , implemented using the PyTorch framework , consists of 3 hidden layers , 100 nodes in each layer , tanh activation , and a single linear output node .
We used Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and 10 epochs .
We applied a dropout of 0.2 .
For Gaussian binning , we vectorized the numerical features into 10 dimensional vectors .
The model takes half hour to train on 1 NVIDIA GeForce GPU .
We do not perform any extensive hyperparameter tuning .
We just examined few values for learning rate ( 0.001 , 0.01 and 0.1 ) and chose the best based on the SARI score on the dev set .

We use the complex - simple sentence pairs from WIKI - AUTO ( Jiang et al . , 2020 ) , which contains 138,095 article pairs and 604k non - identical aligned and partially - aligned sentence pairs .
To capture sentence splitting , we join the sentences in the simple article mapped to the same sentence in the complex article .
Similar to Newsela , we remove the sentence pairs with high ( > 0.9 ) and low ( < 0.1 ) BLEU ( Papineni et al . , 2002 ) scores .
For validation and testing purposes , we use the followingtwo corpora : ( i ) TURK corpus ( Xu et
al . , 2015 ) for lexical paraphrasing and ( ii ) ASSET corpus ( AlvaManchego et al . , 2020 ) for multiple rewrite operations .
While the former corpus has 8 humanwritten references for 2000 validation and 359 test sentences , the latter corpus provides 10 references for the same sentences .
We remove the validation and test sentences from the training corpus .
Tables 12 and 13 show the results on TURK andASSET respectively .
