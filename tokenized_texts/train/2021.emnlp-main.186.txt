However , there is little attempt to combine these two types of models , which inituitively possess complementary advantages .
In this paper , we propose a novel sentence ordering framework which introduces two classiﬁers to make better use of pairwise orderings for graph - based sentence ordering ( Yin et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) .
Specially , given an initial sentence - entity graph , we ﬁrst introduce a graph - based classiﬁer to predict pairwise orderings between linked sentences .
Then , in an iterative manner , based on the graph updated by previously predicted highconﬁdent pairwise orderings , another classiﬁer is used to predict the remaining uncertain pairwise orderings .
At last , we adapt a GRN - based sentence ordering model ( Yin et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) on the basis of ﬁnal graph .
Experiments on ﬁve commonly - used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our model .
Particularly , when equipped with BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) and FHDecoder ( Yin et al . , 2020 ) , our model achieves state - of - the - art performance .

1 Introduction With the rapid development and increasing applications of natural language processing ( NLP ) , modeling text coherence has become a signiﬁcant task , since it can provide beneﬁcial information for understanding , evaluating and generating multi - sentence texts .
As an important subtask , sentence ordering aims at recovering unordered sentences back to naturally coherent paragraphs .
It is required to deal with logic and syntactic consistency , and has increasingly attracted attention due to its wide applications on several tasks such as text generation ( Konstas and Lapata , 2012 ;
Holtzman et al . , 2018 ) Corresponding authorand extractive summarization ( Barzilay et al . , 2002 ; Nallapati et al . , 2012 ) .
Recently , inspired by the great success of deep learning in other NLP tasks , researchers have resorted to neural sentence ordering models , which can be classiﬁed into : pairwise ordering models ( Chen et al . , 2016 ; Agrawal et al . , 2016 ; Li and Jurafsky , 2017 ; Moon et al . , 2019 ; Kumar et al . , 2020 ; Prabhumoye et al . , 2020 ;
Zhu et al . , 2021 ) andset - to - sequence models ( Gong et al . , 2016 ; Nguyen and Joty , 2017 ; Logeswaran et al . , 2018 ; Mohiuddin et al . , 2018 ; Cui et al . , 2018 ; Yin et al . , 2019 ; Oh et al . , 2019 ; Yin et al . , 2020 ; Cui et al . , 2020 ; Yin et al . , 2021 ) .
Generally , the former predicts the relative orderings between pairwise sentences , which are then leveraged to produce the ﬁnal ordered sentence sequence .
Its advantage lies in the lightweight pairwise ordering predictions , since the predictions only depend on the semantic representations of involved sentences .
By contrast , the latter is mainly based on an encoder - decoder framework , where an encoder is ﬁrst used to learn contexualized sentence representations by considering other sentences , and then a decoder , such as pointer network ( Vinyals et al . , 2015a ) , outputs ordered sentences .
Overall , these two kinds of models have their own strengths , which are complementary to each other .
To combine their advantages , Yin et al .
( 2020 ) propose FHDecoder that is equipped with three pairwise ordering prediction modules to enhance the pointer network decoder .
Along this line , Cui et al . ( 2020 ) introduce BERT to exploit the deep semantic connection and relative orderings between sentences and achieve SOTA performance when equipped with FHDecoder .
However , there still exist two drawbacks : 1 ) their pairwise ordering predictions only depend on involved sentence pairs , without considering other sentences in the same set ; 2 ) their one - pass pairwise ordering predictions are relatively rough , ignoring distinct difﬁculties in
2408predicting different sentence pairs .
Therefore , we believe that the potential of pairwise orderings in neural sentence ordering models has not been fully exploited .
In this paper , we propose a novel iterative pairwise ordering prediction framework which introduces two classiﬁers to make better use of pairwise orderings for graph - based sentence ordering ( Yin et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) .
As an extension of SentenceEnity Graph Recurrent Network ( SE - GRN ) ( Yin et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) , our framework enriches the graph representation with iteratively predicted orderings between pairwise sentences , which further beneﬁts the subsequent generation of ordered sentences .
The basic intuitions behind our work are two - fold .
First , learning contextual sentence representations is helpful to predict pairwise orderings .
Second , difﬁculties of predicting ordering vary with respect to different sentence pairs .
Thus , it is more reasonable to ﬁrst predict the orderings of pairwise sentences easily to be predicted , and then leverage these predicted orderings to reﬁne the predictions for other pairwise sentences .
Concretely , we propose two graph - based classiﬁers to iteratively conduct ordering predictions for pairwise sentences .
The ﬁrst classiﬁer takes the sentence - entity graph ( SE - Graph ) ( Yin et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) as input and yields relative orderings of linked sentences via corresponding probabilities .
Next , in an iterative manner , the second classiﬁer enriches the previous graph representation by converting high - value probabilities into the weights of the corresponding edges , and then reconduct graph encoding to predict orderings for the other pairwise sentences .
Based on the ﬁnal weighted graph representation , we adapt SE - GRN to construct a graph - based sentence ordering model , of which the decoder is also a pointer network .
To the best of our knowledge , our work is the ﬁrst to exploit pairwise orderings to enhance the graph encoding for graph - based set - to - squence sentence ordering .
To investigate the effectiveness of our framework , we conduct extensive experiments on several commonly - used datasets .
Experimental results and in - depth analyses show that our model enhanced with some proposed technologies ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ; Yin et
al . , 2020 ) achieves the state - of - the - art performance.2 Related Work Early studies mainly focused on exploring humandesigned features for sentence ordering ( Lapata , 2003 ; Barzilay and Lee , 2004 ; Barzilay and Lapata , 2005 , 2008 ; Elsner and Charniak , 2011 ; Guinaudeau and Strube , 2013 ) .
Recently , neural network based sentence ordering models have become dominant , consisting of the following two kinds of models : 1)Pairwise models .
Generally , they ﬁrst predict the pairwise orderings between sentences and then use them to produce the ﬁnal sentence order via ranking algorithms ( Chen et al . , 2016 ;
Agrawal et al . , 2016 ; Li and Jurafsky , 2017 ; Kumar et al . , 2020 ; Prabhumoye et al . , 2020 ; Zhu et al . , 2021 ) .
For example , Chen et al .
( 2016 ) ﬁrst framed sentence ordering as a ranking task conditioned on pairwise scores .
Agrawal et
al .
( 2016 ) conducted the same experiments as ( Chen et al . , 2016 ) in the task of image caption storytelling .
Similarly , Li and Jurafsky ( 2017 ) investigated the effectiveness of discriminative and generative models on ordering pairs of sentences in small domains .
Moon et
al .
( 2019 ) proposed a uniﬁed model that incorporates sentence grammar , pairwise coherence and global coherence into a common neural framework .
Recently , Prabhumoye et al . ( 2020 ) and Zhu et al .
( 2021 ) employed ranking techniques to ﬁnd the right order of the sentences under the constraint of the predicted pairwise sentence ordering ; 2)Set - to - sequence Models .
Basically , these models are based on an encoder - decoder framework , where the encoder is used to obtain sentence representations and then the decoder produces ordered sentences progressively .
Among them , both Gong et al . ( 2016 ) and Logeswaran et
al .
( 2018 ) explored RNN based encoder , while both Nguyen and Joty ( 2017 ) and Mohiuddin et al .
( 2018 ) employed neural entity grid models as encoders .
Typically , Cui et al . ( 2018 ) proposed ATTOrderNet that uses self - attention mechanism to learn sentence representations .
Inspired by the successful applications of graph neural network ( GNN ) in many NLP tasks ( Song et al . , 2018 ;
Xue et al . , 2019 ; Song et al . , 2019 , 2020 ) , Yin
et al .
( 2019 , 2021 ) represented input sentences with a uniﬁed SE - Graph and then applied GRN to learn sentence representations .
Very recently , we notice that Chowdhury et
al .
( 2021 ) proposes a BART - based sentence ordering model .
Please note that our porposed framework is compatible with BART ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ) .
For
2409 Figure 1 : The architecture of SE - GRN model ( Yin et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) .
example , we can easily adapt the BART encoder as our sentence encoder .
With similar motivation with ours , that is , to combine advantages of above - mentioned two kinds of models , Yin et al .
( 2020 ) introduced three pairwise ordering predicting modules ( FHDecoder ) to enhance the pointer network decoder of ATTOrderNet .
Recently , Cui et al . ( 2020 ) proposed BERSON that is also equipped with FHDecoder and utilizes BERT to exploit the deep semantic connection and relative ordering between sentences .
However , signiﬁcantly different from them , we borrow the idea from the mask - predict framework ( Gu et al . , 2018 ; Ghazvininejad et al . , 2019 ; Deng et al . , 2020 ) to progressively incorporate pairwise ordering information into SE - Graph , which is the basis of our graph - based sentence ordering model .
To the best of our knowledge , our work is the ﬁrst attempt to explore iteratively reﬁned GNN for sentence ordering .
3 Background In this section , we give a brief introduction to the SE - GRN ( Yin et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) , which is selected as our baseline due to its competitive performance .
As shown in Figure 1 , SE - GRN is composed of a Bi - LSTM sentence encoder , GRN ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) paragraph encoder , and a pointer network ( Vinyals et al . , 2015b ) decoder .
3.1 Sentence - Entity Graph The SE - GRN takes Isentencess=
[ so1;:::;s oI ] as input and tries to predict their correct order o= [ o 1;:::;o I ] .
At ﬁrst , each sentence soi is fed into a Bi - LSTM sentence encoder , where the concatenation of the last hidden states in two directions is used as the context - aware sentence representation (0 ) oi .
As illustrated in the middle of Figure 1 , each input sentence set is rep - resented as an undirected sentence - entity graph G= ( V;E ) ,
whereV = fvigI i=1[f^vjgJ j=1and E
= fei;i0gI;I i=1;i0=1[fei;jgI;J i=1;j=1[f^ej;j0gJ;J j=1;j0=1 represent the nodes and edges respectively .
Here , nodes include sentence nodes ( such asvi ) and entity nodes ( such as ^vj ) , and each edge is 1 ) sentencesentence edge ( ss - edge , such asei;i0 ) linking two sentences having the same entity ; or 2 ) sentenceentity edge ( se - edge , such as ei;j ) connecting an entity to a sentence that contains it .
Each se - edge is assigned with a label including subject , object or other , based on the syntactic role of its involved entity ; or 3 ) entity - entity edge ( ee - edge , such as ^ej;j0 ) connecting two semantic related entities .
Besides , a virtual global node connecting to all nodes is introduced to capture global information effectively .
3.2 Paragraph Encoding with GRN Node representations of each sentence and each entity are ﬁrst initialized with the concatenation of bidirectional last states of the Bi - LSTM sentence encoder and the corresponding GloVe word embedding , respectively .
Then , a GRN is adapted to encode the above sentence - entity graph , where node states are updated iteratively .
During the process of updating hidden states , the messages for each node are aggregated from its adjacent nodes .
Speciﬁcally , the sentence - level message m(l ) iand entity - level message ~m(l ) ifor a sentence siare deﬁned as follows : m(l ) i = X vi02Niw((l-1 ) i;(l-1 ) i0)(l-1 ) i0 ; ^m(l )
i = X vj2^Niw((l-1 ) i;(l-1 ) j;rij)(l-1 ) j;(1 ) where(l-1 ) i0and(l-1 ) jstand for the neighboring sentence and entity representations of the i - th sentence nodeviat the ( l 1)-th layer , Niand^Nidenote the sets of neighboring sentences and entities of vi , and bothw()andw()are gating functions with single - layer networks , involving associated node states and edge label rij(if any ) .
Afterwards,(l-1 ) iis updated by concatenating its original representation (0 )
i , the messages from neighbours ( m(l ) iand^m(l ) i ) and the global state g(l-1)via GRU : (l ) i=
[ (0 ) i;m(l ) i;^m(l ) i;g(l-1 ) ] ; (l ) i
= GRU((l ) i;(l-1 ) i0):(2 ) Similar to updating sentence nodes , each entity state(l-1 ) jis updated based on its word embedding

The above updating process is iterated for L times .
Usually , the top hidden states are considered as ﬁne - grained graph representations , which will provide dynamical context for the decoder via attention mechanism .
3.3 Decoding with Pointer Network Given the learned hidden states f(L ) igandg(L ) , the prediction procedure for order o0can be formalized as follows : P(o0jK(L ) )
= IY t=1P(o0 tjo0 < t;K(L ) o0 t 1 ) ; P(o0 tjo0 < t;K(L ) o0 t 1 ) = softmax ( qTtanh(Whd t+UK(L ) o0 t 1 ) ) ; hd t = LSTM ( hd t 1;(0 ) o0 t 1 ): ( 5 ) Here , q , WandUare learnable parameters , K(L )
o0 t 1andhd tdenote the sentence representations with predicted orderh (L ) o0 1;:::;(L ) o0 t 1i and the decoder hidden state at the t - th time step , which is initialized byg(L)ast=0 , respectively.4 Our Framework In this section , we give a detailed description to our framework .
As shown in Figure 2 , we ﬁrst introduce two graph - based classiﬁers to construct an iteratively reﬁned sentence - entity graph ( IRSEGraph ) .
It is a weighted version of SE - Graph , where pairwise ordering inforamtion is iteratively incorporated to update ss - edge weights .
Then , we adapt the conventional GRN to establish a neural sentence ordering model based on the ﬁnal IRSEGraph .
4.1 The Deﬁnition of IRSE - Graph As an extension of SE - Graph , IRSE - Graph can be denoted asG=(V;E;W ) , whereVandEshare the same deﬁnitions with those of SE - Graph .
Particularly , in IRSE - Graph , each ss - edge ei;i0is a directed one with a weight wi;i02Windicating the probability of sentence sioccurring before sentence si0 .
Meanwhile , there must exist a corresponding ssedgeei0;iwith the weight wi0;i=1 wi;i0denoting the probability of siappearing after si0 .
For example , in Figure 2 , for two linked sentence nodes v1andv2 , there exist two ss - edges e1;2ande2;1 with weights w1;2andw2;1respectively , both of which are iteratively updated during constructing IRSE - Graph .
4.2 Constructing IRSE - Graph Inspired by Gui et al .
( 2020 ) , we successively introduce two classiﬁers — initial classiﬁer anditerative classiﬁer to construct IRSE - Graph .
Both classiﬁers are constructed using slightly adapted GRN and utilized to deal with different scenarios , respectively .
In this way , we can fully exploit the
2411potential of iterative classiﬁer to predict better pairwise orderings .
We will give a detail introduction to the slightly adapted GRN in Section § 4.3 .
To better understand the procedure of constructing IRSE - Graph , we provide the details in Algorithm 1 .
During this procedure , pairwise orderings are iteratively predicted and gradually incorporated to reﬁne IRSE - Graph .
Here we introduce a set VP(k)to collect sentence node pairs with uncertain pairwise orderings at the k - th iteration .
First , we bulid an initial classiﬁer based on the initial IRSE - Graph , where the learned sentence representations are used to predict pairwise orderings between any two linked sentences only once ( Lines 2 - 6 ) .
Note that in the initial IRSEGraph , all weights of ss - edges are set to 0.5 .
In this case , IRSE - Graph degrades to the conventional SE - Graph .
Concretely , for any two linked sentence nodesviandvi0 , we concatenate their vector representationsiandi0as[i;i0]and[i0;i ] , which are fed into an MLP classiﬁer to obtain two probabilities .
Then , we normalize and convert these two probabilities into ss - edge weights wi;i0 andwi0;i .
If bothwi;i0andwi0;iare within a preﬁxed interval [ min;max ] , we consider ( vi;vi0)as a sentence node pair with uncertain pairwise ordering and add it into VP(0 ) .
Moreover , we replace bothwi;i0andwi0;iwith 0.5 , indicating that they will be repredicted in the next iteration .
In the following , we also construct an iterative classiﬁer based on IRSE - Graph .
However , in an easy - to - hard manner , we use iterative classiﬁer to perform pairwise ordering predictions , where the ss - edge weights of IRSE - Graph are continously updated with previously - predicted pairwise orderings with high conﬁdence ( Lines 13 - 26 ) .
By doing so , graph representations can be continously reﬁned for better subsequent predictions .
More speciﬁcally , thek - th iteration of this classiﬁer mainly involve three steps : InStep 1 , based on the current IRSE - Graph , we employ the adapted GRN to conduct graph encoding to learn sentence representations ( Line 15 ) .
InStep 2 , on the top of learned sentence representations , we stack an MLP classiﬁer to predict pairwise orderings for sentence node pairs in VP(k ) ( Lines 16 - 19 ) .
Likewise , we collect sentence node pairs with uncertain pairwise orderings to form VP(k+1 ) , and reassign their corresponding ss - edge weights as 0.5 , so as to avoid the negative effect of these uncertain ss - edge weights during the nextAlgorithm 1
The procedure of constructing IRSE - Graph Input : the initial IRSE - Graph : G=(V;E;W)with all wi;i0=0 ; two thresholds : min;max Output : the ﬁnal IRSE - Graph : G= ( V;E;W ) 1 : VP(0 ) ; 2 : figI i=1 GRN(G ) 3 : forany linked sentence node pair ( vi;vi0)&&i < i0do 4 : wi;i0 InitialClassifer ( [ i;i0 ] ) 5 : wi0;i InitialClassifer ( [ i0;i ] ) 6 : wi;i0;wi0;i Normalize ( wi;i0;wi0;i ) 7 : ifminwi;i0max then 8 : VP(0 ) VP(0)[f(vi;vi0)g 9 : wi;i0 0:5,wi0;i 0:5 10 : end if 11 : end for 12 : k 0 13 : repeat 14 : VP(k+1 ) ; 15 : figI i=1 GRN(G ) 16 : for(vi;vi0)2VP(k)do 17 :

iteration ( Lines 20 - 23 ) .
InStep 3 , ifVP(k+1)is equal to VP(k)or empty , we believe the learning of IRSE - Graph Ghas converged and thus return it ( Lines 26 - 27 ) .
Although both of our classiﬁers are constructed using IRSE - Graph , their training procedures are slightly different .
As for initial classiﬁer , we directly train it on the initial IRSE - Graph without any pairwise ordering information ( all ss - edge weights are set to 0.5 ) .
By contrast , we train iterative classiﬁer on IRSE - Graph with partial pairwise orderings .
To enable iterative classiﬁer generalizable to any IRSE - Graph with partial predicted pairwise orderings , we ﬁrst set all ss - edge weights to 1 or 0 according to their ground - truth pairwise orderings , and then train the classiﬁer to correctly predict pari-
2412wise orderings for other pairs .
Concretely , if siappears beforesi0 , we setwi;i0=1andwi0;i=0 , vice versa .
For example , in the left part of Figure 3 , the ground - truth sentence sequence is s1,s2,s3,s4 , and thus we assign the ss - edge weights of linked sentence node pairs ( v1;v2),(v3;v2),(v3;v4),(v2;v4 ) as follows : w1;2=1,w2;3=1,w2;4=1,w3;4=1 , and w2;1=0,w3;2=0,w4;2=0,w4;3=0 .
Moreover , to enhance the robustness of the iterative classiﬁer , we randomly select a certain ratio of sentence pairs and assign their ss - edges with incorrect weights .
Let us revisit Figure 3 , for the randomly selected sentence node pair ( v1;v2 ) , we assign ss - edges weights w1;2andw2;1with randomly generated noisy values 0.3 and 0.7 respectively .
In this way , we expect that iterative classiﬁer can conduct correct predictions even given incorrect previously - predicted pairwise orderings .
4.3 IRSE - Graph Sentence Ordering Model Finally , following the conventional SE - GRN ( Yin et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) , we construct a graph - based sentence ordering model .
Note that the above two classiﬁers and our sentence ordering model are all based on IRSE - Graph rather than the conventional SE - Graph , which makes the standard GRN unable to be applied directly .
To deal with this issue , we slightly adapt GRN to utilize pairwise ordering information for graph encoding .
Speciﬁcally , we adapt Equation 1 to incorporate ss - edge weights into the message aggregation of sentence - level nodes : m(l ) i = X vi02Niwi;i0w((l-1 ) i;(l-1 ) i0)(l-1 ) i0 ; w((l-1 ) i;(l-1 ) i0 )
= (Wg[(l-1 ) i;(l-1 ) i0]):(6 ) Heredenotes sigmoid function and Wgis learnable parameter matrix .
Equation 6 expresses that the sentence - level aggregation should consider not only the semantic representations of the two involved sentences , but also the relative ordering between them .
In addition , other Equations are the same as those of conventional GRN , which have been described in Section § 3.2 . 5 Experiment 5.1 Setup Datasets .
Following previous work ( Yin et al . , 2020 ;
Cui et al . , 2018 ; Yin et al . , 2021 ) , we carry out experiments on ﬁve benchmark datasets : SIND , ROCStory .
SIND ( Huang et al . , 2016 ) is a visual storytelling dataset and ROCStory(Mostafazadeh et
al . , 2016 ) is about commonsense stories .
Both two datasets are composed of 5 - sentence stories and randomly split by 8:1:1 for the training / validation / test sets .
NIPS Abstract , AAN Abstract , arXiv Abstract .
These three datasets consist of abstracts from research papers , which are collected from NIPS , ACL anthology and arXiv , respectively ( Radev et al . , 2016 ; Chen et al . , 2016 ) .
The partitions for training / validation / test of each dataset are as follows : NIPS Abstract : 2,427/408/377 , AAN Abstract : 8,569/962/2,626 , arXiv Abstract : 884,912/110,614/110,615 for the training / validation / test sets .
Settings .
For fair comparison , we use the same settings as our most related baseline SE - GRN ( Yin et al . , 2021 ) for our model and its variants .
Speciﬁcally , we apply 100 - dimensional GloVe word embeddings , and set the sizes of Bi - LSTM hidden states , sentence node states , and entity node states as 512 , 512 and 150 , respectively .
The recurrent step of GRN is 3 .
We empirically set thresholds minandmax as 0.2 and 0.8 , and set as 20 % , 15 % , 25 % , 15 % , 15 % according to accuracies of initial classiﬁer on validation sets .
Besides , we individually set the coefﬁcient (See Equation 18 in ( Yin et al . , 2020 ) ) as 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.5 on the ﬁve datasets .
We adopt Adadelta ( Zeiler , 2012 ) with=10 6,=0:95and initial learning rate 1.0 as the optimizer .
We employ L2 weight decay with coefﬁcient 10 5 , batch size of 16 and dropout rate of 0.5 .
When constructing our model based on BERT , we use the same settings as ( Cui et al . , 2020 ) .
Concretely , we set sizes of hidden states and node states to 768 , the learning rate of BERT as 3e-3 , the batch size as 16 , 32 , 128 , 128 , 64 for the ﬁve datasets .

Furthermore , to examine the compatibility of other technologies with our model , we report the performance of IRSE - GRN equipped with some effective components : 1 ) IRSE - GRN+FHDecoder .
In this variant , we equip our model with FHDecoder ( Yin et al . , 2020 ) , where pairwise ordering information is incorporated ; 2 ) IRSEGRN+BERT+FHDecoder .
In addition to FHDecoder , we construct the sentence encoder based on BERT , where the mean - pooling outputs of all learned word representations are used to initialize sentence nodes .
Evaluation Metrics .
Following previous work ( Oh et al . , 2019 ; Cui et al . , 2020 ; Prabhumoye et al . , 2020 ; Zhu et al . , 2021 ; Yin et al . , 2021 ) , we use the following three metrics : 1 ) Kendall ’s Tau (  ): Formally , this metric is calculated as 12(number of inversions ) / I
2 , whereIdenotes the sequence length and number of inversions is the number of pairs in the predicted sequence with incorrect relative order ( Lapata , 2003 ) ; 2 ) Perfect Match Ratio ( PMR ) :
This metric calculates the ratio of samples where the entire sequence is correctly predicted ( Chen et al . , 2016 ) ; 3 ) Accuracy ( Acc ) :
This metric measures the percentage of sentences , whose absolute positions are correctly predicted ( Logeswaran et al . , 2018 ) .
5.2 Pairwise Ordering Since pairwise ordering plays a crucial role in our proposed framework , we ﬁrst compare the performance of different classiﬁers on various datasets .
Table 2 shows the experimental results .
Obviously , the utilization of iterative classiﬁer further beneﬁtsDataset Initial Classiﬁer Initial + Iterative Classiﬁers NIPS Abstract 80.46 % 86.32 % AAN Abstract 84.53 % 86.74 % SIND 77.72 % 83.55 % ROCstory 87.59 % 92.23 % arXiv Abstract 84.09 % 86.82 % Table 2 : The accuracies of our two classiﬁers on ﬁve test datasets .
the predictions of pairwise orderings .
5.3 Main Results Table 1 reports the overall experimental results of sentence ordering .
When incorporating BERT and FHDecoder into IRSE - GRN , our model achieves SOTA performance on most of datasets .
Besides , we arrive at the following conclusions : First , IRSE - GRN signiﬁcantly surpasses SEGRN on all datasets ( bootstrapping test , p<0:01 ) , indicating that iteratively reﬁning graph representations indeed beneﬁt the ordering of input sentences .
Second , IRSE - GRN+FHDecoder exhibits better performance than IRSE - GRN and all non - BERT baselines , which are shown above the upper dotted line of Table 1 , across datasets in different domains .
Therefore , we conﬁrm that our framework is orthogonal to the current approach exploiting pairwise ordering information for decoder .
Third , when constructing our model based on BERT , IRSE - GRN+BERT+FHDecoder also outperforms all BERT - based baselines , such as ConsGraph , BERSON , achieving SOTA performance .
It can be known that our proposed framework is also effective when combining with pretrained language model .
2414 Figure 4 : The Kendall ’s  of different models with respect to different sentence numbers on the arXiv abstract test set .
Finally , we note that IRSE - GRN+BERT+FHDecoder gains relatively marginal improvement on SIND and ROCStory , and performs worse than BERSON in PMR on SIND .
We speculate that there exist less ss - edges on these two datasets , resulting in that our proposed framework can not achieve its full potential .
Speciﬁcally , average edge numbers of SIND and ROCStory are 2.85 and 5.66 respectively , far fewer than 16.60 , 10.86 and 16.73 on NIPS Abstract , ANN Abstract and arXiv Abstract .
Besides , since it is a challenge to order longer paragraphs , we investigate the Kendall ’s  of our models and SE - GRN with respect to different sentence numbers , as shown in Figure 4 .
Overall , all models degrade with the increase of sentence number .
However , our model and its two enhanced versions always exhibit better performance than SE - GRN .
5.4 Predictions of the First and Last Sentences As mentioned in previous studies ( Gong et al . , 2016 ; Chen et al . , 2016 ; Cui et al . , 2018 ;
Oh et al . , 2019 ) , the ﬁrst and last sentences are very important in a paragraph .
Following these studies , we compare models by conducting experiments to predict the ﬁrst and last sentences .
As displayed in Table 3 , IRSE - GRN surpasses all non - BERT baselines , and IRSE - GRN+BERT+ FHDecoder wins against BERTSON .
These results are consistent with those reported in Table 1 , further demonstrating the effectiveness of our model .

datasets .
All results are provided in Table 4 , where we draw the following conclusions : First , using only iterative classiﬁer , IRSEGRN(w / o initial classiﬁer ) performs worse than IRSE - GRN .
This result proves that iterative classiﬁer fails to predict well from scratch and the pairwise ordering predicted by initial classiﬁer is beneﬁcial to construct a well - formed graph representation for iterative classiﬁer .
Second , when the iteration number kis set as 1 , the performance of IRSE - GRN decreases .
Moreover , if we remove iterative classiﬁer , the performance of IRSE - GRN becomes even worse .
Therefore , we conﬁrm that the iterative predictions of pairwise ordering indeed beneﬁt the learning of graph representations .
Finally , the result in the last line indicates that removing noisy weights leads to a signiﬁcant performance drop .
It suggests that the utilization of noisy weights is useful for the training of iterative classiﬁer , which makes our model more robust .

spect the validity of our proposed framework via multi - document summarization .
Concretely , we train different neural sentence ordering models on a large - scale summarization corpus ( Fabbri et al . , 2019 ) , and then individually use them to reorder the small - scale summarization data of DUC2004 ( Task2 ) .
Finally , we use coherence probability proposed by ( Nayeem and Chali , 2017 ) to evaluate the coherence of summaries .
In this group of experiments , we conduct experiments using different weights : 0.5 and 0.8 , as implemented in ( Nayeem and Chali , 2017 ) and ( Yin et al . , 2020 ) respectively .
The results are reported in Table 5 .
We can observe that the summaries reordered by IRSE - GRN and its variants achieve higher coherence probabilities than baseline , verifying the effectiveness of our proposed framework in the downstream task .
5.7 Further Experiment Results To provide more experimental results , we summarize the runtime on the validation sets and the numbers of parameters for our enhanced models and baseline SE - GRN in Table 6 . 6 Conclusion In this work , we propose a novel sentence ordering framework that makes better use of pairwise orderings for graph - based sentence ordering .
Specifically , we introduce two classiﬁers to iteratively predict pairwise orderings , which are gradually incorporated into the graph as edge weights .
Then , based on this reﬁned graph , we construct a graph - based sentence ordering model .
Experiments on ﬁve datasets demonstrate not only the superiority of our model over baselines , but also the compatibility to other modules utilizing pairwise ordering information .
Moreover , when equipped with BERT and FHDecoder , our enhanced model achieves SOTA performance across datasets .
In the future , we plan to explore more effective GNN for sentence ordering .
In particular , we will improve our model by iteratively merging nodes to reﬁne the graph representation .
