Abstract Lemlat is a morphological analyser for Latin , which shows a remarkably wide coverage of the Latin lexicon .
However , the performance of the tool is limited by the absence of proper names in its lexical basis .
In this paper we present the extension of Lemlat with a large Onomasticon for Latin .
First , we describe and motivate the automatic and manual proce - dures for including the proper names in Lem - lat .
Then , we compare the new version of Lemlat with the previous one , by evaluating their lexical coverage of four Latin texts of different era and genre .
1 Introduction Since the time of the Index Thomisticus by father Roberto Busa ( Busa , 1974 - 1980 ) , which is usual - ly mentioned among the first electronic ( nowa - days called “ digital ” ) annotated corpora availa - ble , NLP tools for automatic morphological analysis and lemmatisation of a richly inflected language like Latin were needed .
Over the last decades , this need was fulfilled by a number of morphological analysers for Latin .
Among the most widespread ones are Morpheus ( Crane , 1991 ) , Whitaker ’s Words ( http://archives.nd.edu/words.html ) and Lemlat ( Passarotti , 2004 ) .
Over the past ten years , such tools have become essential , in light of a number of projects aimed at developing advanced lan - guage resources for Latin , like treebanks.1
The most recent advances in linguistic annota - tion of Latin treebanks are moving beyond the                                                  1 Three dependency treebanks are currently available for Latin : the Latin Dependency Treebank ( Bamman and Crane , 2006 ) , the Index Thomisticus Treebank ( Passarotti , 2009 ) and the Latin portion of the PROIEL corpus ( Haug and Jøndal , 2008 ) .
level of syntax , by performing semantic - based tasks like semantic role labelling and anaphora and ellipsis resolution ( Passarotti , 2014 ) .
In par - ticular , in the area of Digital Humanities there is growing interest in Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) , especially for purposes of geographical - based analysis of texts .
NER is a sub - branch of Information Extrac - tion , whose inception goes back to the Sixth Message Understanding Conference ( MUC-6 ) ( Grishman and Sundheim , 1996 ) .
NER aims at recognising and labelling ( multi)words , as names of people , things , places , etc .
Since MUC-6 , NER has largely expanded , with several applica - tions also on ancient languages ( see , for exam - ple , Depauw and Van Beek , 2009 ) .
Although Lemlat provides quite a large cover - age of the Latin lexicon , its performance is lim - ited by the absence of an Onomasticon in its lex - ical basis , which would be helpful for tasks like NER .
Given that in Latin proper names undergo morphological inflection , in this paper we de - scribe our work of enhancing Lemlat with an Onomasticon .
The paper is organised as follows .
Section 2 presents the basic features of Lemlat .
Section 3 describes our method to enhance Lem - lat with an Onomasticon , by detailing the rules for the automatic enhancement and discussing the most problematic kinds of words .
Section 4 evaluates the rules and presents one experiment run on four Latin texts .
Section 5 is a short con - clusion and sketches the future work .
2 Lemlat The lexical basis of Lemlat results from the col - lation of three Latin dictionaries ( Georges and Georges , 1913 - 1918 ; Glare , 1982 ; Gradenwitz , 1904 ) .
It counts 40,014 lexical entries and 43,432 lemmas , as more than one lemma can be includ - ed into the same lexical entry . 
91
Given an input wordform that is recognised by Lemlat , the tool produces in output the corre - sponding lemma(s ) and a number of tags convey - ing ( a ) the inflectional paradigm of the lemma(s ) ( e.g. first declension noun ) and ( b ) the morpho - logical features of the input wordform ( e.g. sin - gular nominative ) , as well as the identification number ( ID ) of the lemma(s ) in the lexical basis of Lemlat .
No contextual disambiguation is per - formed .
For instance , receiving in input the wordform abamitae ( “ great - aunt ” ) , Lemlat outputs the cor - responding lemma ( abamita , ID : A0019 ) , the tags for its inflectional paradigm ( N1 : first declension noun ) and those for the morphological features of the input wordform ( feminine singular geni - tive and dative ; feminine plural nominative and vocative ) .  
The basic component of the lexical look - up table used by Lemlat to analyse input wordforms is the so - called LES ( “ LExical Segment ” ) .
The LES is defined as the invariable part of the in - flected form ( e.g. abamit for abamit - ae ) .
In other words , the LES is the sequence ( or one of the se - quences ) of characters that remains the same in the inflectional paradigm of a lemma ( hence , the LES does not necessarily correspond to the word stem ) .
Lemlat includes a LES archive , in which LES are assigned an ID and a number of inflectional features among which are a tag for the gender of the lemma ( for nouns only ) and a code ( called CODLES ) for its inflectional category .
According to the CODLES , the LES is compatible with the endings of its inflectional paradigm .
For in - stance , the CODLES for the LES abamit is N1 ( first declension nouns ) and its gender is F ( feminine ) .
The wordform abamitae is thus analysed as be - longing to the LES abamit because the segment -ae is recognised as an ending compatible with a LES with CODLES N1 .
3 Enhancing Lemlat .
Method The bedrock of our work is Busa ’s ( 1988 )
Totius Latinitatis Lemmata , which contains the list of the lemmas ( 92,052 ) from the 5th edition of Lexi - con Totius Latinitatis ( Forcellini , 1940 ) .
In Busa ( 1988 ) , three kinds of metadata are assigned to each lemma : ( a ) a code for the section of the dic - tionary in which the lemma occurs ( e.g. ON : the lemma occurs in the Onomasticon ) , ( b ) a code for the inflectional paradigm the lemma belongs to and its gender ( e.g. BM : second declension masculine nouns ) and ( c ) the number of lines of the lexical entry for the lemma in Forcellini .
In order to enhance Lemlat with Forcellini ’s Onomasticon , we first extracted from Busa ( 1988 ) the list of those lemmas that occur in the ON section .
This list counts 28,178 lemmas .
Then , we built a number of rules to automatically include the lemmas of the Onomasticon into the lexical basis of Lemlat .
3.1 Types of Rules Including the Onomasticon of Forcellini into Lemlat means converting the list of proper names provided by Busa ( 1988 ) into the same format of the LES archive .
In order to perform this task as automatically as possible , we built a number of rules to extract the relevant infor - mation for each lemma in the list , namely its LES , CODLES and gender .
By exploiting the morpho - logical tagging of Busa ( 1988 ) , which groups sets of lemmas showing common inflectional features , our rules treat automatically such in - flectionally regular groups .
In total , we wrote 122 rules , which fall into four types .
The first type ( 60 rules ) builds the LES by re - moving one or more characters from the right side of the lemma .
Such a removal is constrained by the code for the inflectional paradigm of the lemma , which is then used to create both the CODLES and the tag for the gender .
For instance , the lemma marcus ( “ Mark ” ) is assigned the in - flectional paradigm BM in Busa ( 1988 ) .
One rule states that the LES for BM lemmas ending in -us is built by removing the last two characters from the lemma ( marcus > marc )
The inflectional code BM stands for second declension ( B ) mascu - line ( M ) nouns : this is converted into the CODLES of Lemlat for second declension nouns ( B > N2 ) and into the tag for masculine gender ( M > m ) .
The second type of rules ( 19 ) adds one or more characters on the right side of the lemma to build the LES .
Again , this is done according both to the inflectional paradigm and to the ending of the lemma in Busa ( 1988 ) .
For instance , the LES for lemmas with inflectional code CM ( third de - clension masculine nouns ) and ending in -o is built by adding an -n after the last character .
One example is the lemma bappo ( “ Bappo ” ) , whose LES is bappon , as third declension imparisyllable nouns are analysed by Lemlat by using the basis for their singular genitive ( bappon - is ) .
The third type of rules ( 19 ) replaces one or more characters on the right side of the lemma with others .
For instance , the LES of clemens ( “ Clement ” , third declension masculine noun  92
ending in -s , with singular genitive clement - is ) is built by replacing the final -s with a -t ( clement ) .  
The last type of rules ( 24 ) deals with those lemmas that are equal to their LES ( no change is needed ) .
These are uninflected nouns , ( like ha - milcar - “ Hamilcar ” ) , which can be easily re - trieved because they are assigned a specific in - flectional code in Busa ( 1988 ) .
3.2 Problematic Cases Not all inflectional paradigms are as much regu - lar as to allow for a fully automatic rule - based treatment .  
For instance , third declension feminine nouns represent an entangled class .
The lemma charyb - dis , -is ( “ Charybdis ” ) is a third declension pari - syllable feminine noun ending in -is .
Instead , phegis , -gidis ( “ daughter of Phegeus ” ) is a third declension imparisyllable feminine noun ending in -is .
One common rule can not be used for these two kinds of words .
We overcome such problem by building two more specific rules : one ac - counting for third declension feminine nouns ending in -dis and one for third declension femi - nine nouns ending in -gis .
However , there are sub - groups of nouns for which such a solution does not work , like third declension feminine nouns ending in -mis , which can be both impari - syllable nouns ( e.g. salamis , -minis , “ Salamis ” ) and parisyllable nouns ( e.g. tomis , -is , “ Tomis ” ) .
For these lemmas we checked manually their inflection in Forcellini and assigned LES and CODLES accordingly .
Another group of tricky words includes those lemmas that show two ( or even more ) different inflectional paradigms .
For instance , apollonid - es ( “ Apollonides ” ) shows both a singular geni - tive of the second declension ( in -i ) and one of the first declension ( in -ae ) .
We treated these cases manually by checking their lexical entries in Forcellini .
A further problem is represented by graphical variants , which are managed by Lemlat through so - called “ exceptional forms ” .
These are word - forms that are hard - coded in the LES archive and are assigned the same ID of the LES used to build their base lemma .
For instance , the nominative singular of the lemma jesus ( “ Jesus ” ) is attested also as hiesus , ihesus and zesus .
Beside the LES jes ( used for the base lemma jesus ) , in the LES archive also the wordforms hiesus , ihesus and zesus are recorded and assigned the same ID of the LES jes .
4 Evaluating the Enhancement We evaluated the enhancement of Lemlat with the Onomasticon of Forcellini in two steps .
First , we focused on the accuracy of the rules for au - tomatic enhancement .
Then , we compared the new version of Lemlat with the previous one by the lexical coverage they provide for four Latin texts .
4.1 Rules We evaluated the quality of the rules for auto - matic enhancement by precision and recall ( Van Rijsbergen , 1979 ) .
Measuring the precision of our rules is straightforward .
As said , while writing the rules , we focused on inflectionally regular groups of lemmas .
As a consequence , we never had to modify the output of rules neither in terms of removal of results ( i.e. wrong results due to overproduction ) nor in terms of completion of results ( i.e. wrong results due to underproduc - tion ) .
Thus , the precision of our rules is always 100 % .
To calculate recall , we grouped all those rules that treat lemmas of the same inflectional class ( e.g. all rules for nouns of the first declension ) .
We measured the recall of such groups of rules by comparing the number of lemmas automati - cally inserted into Lemlat by one group of rules with the total number of lemmas in the Onomas - ticon of Forcellini belonging to the inflectional class addressed by that group of rules .
Table 1 shows the results .  
Inflectional Class Lemmas per Class Lemmas per Rules Recall 1st decl .
6,597 6,597 100 % 2nd decl .
12,968 12,961 99.946 % 3rd decl .
5,397 3,923 72.688 % 4th decl .
50 11 22 % 5th decl .
6 6 100 % Uninflected 1,166 11,66 100 %   26,184 24,664 94.194 %   Table 1 : The recall of rules .  
The most problematic inflectional class is that of third declension nouns.2 As mentioned above , this is motivated by the fact that it is not always                                                  2 The rules for fourth declension nouns show an even lower recall than those for third declension , but the results for such class must be evaluated carefully as the lemmas of the fourth declension in the Onomasticon are just a few ( 50 ) .

possible to match regularly an inflectional para - digm ( e.g. third declension imparisyllable nouns ) with one specific ending .
Hence , given such a low recall , the amount of manual work required for enhancing Lemlat with third declension prop - er names was quite considerable .
To provide an example , the number of third declension femi - nine nouns in the Onomasticon is 1,200 .
Our rules covered only 542 out of them .
Thus , 658 nouns had to be inserted into Lemlat manually ( 54.833 % of the total for that class ) .
There are also entire inflectional classes for which writing a rule was not possible , like for instance Busa ’s class of irregularly inflected nouns ( 146 wordforms ) .
All these lemmas were inserted into the LES archive manually .
In total , the number of lemmas transferred manually into Lemlat is 1,752 ( 6.632 % of all the lemmas of the Onomasticon ) .  
4.2 Coverage We evaluated the enhancement of Lemlat with the Onomasticon of Forcellini by comparing the lexical coverage provided by the two versions of the tool for four Latin texts of similar size and different genre ( prose and poetry ) and era ( Clas - sical and Late Latin).3 Table 2 presents the num - ber of distinct words ( types ) analysed by the original version of Lemlat and by the one en - hanced with the Onomasticon ( LemlatON ) .

The coverage of Lemlat on the four test texts improved of 4.86 % on average after the en - hancement with Forcellini ’s Onomasticon .
The highest improvement is on Virgil ( +5.7 % ) .

All the texts were downloaded from the Perseus Digital Library ( www.perseus.tufts.edu ) .
Most of the words not analysed by LemlatON are graphical variants ( e.g. creüsa for creusa - “ Creusa ” ) or part of the inflectional paradigm of lemmas not available in its lexical basis .
Beside these words , there are Roman numbers ( e.g. XV , “ fifteen ” ) , abbreviations ( e.g. kal for kalendae , “ calends ” ) and foreign words ( e.g. µητέρα , “ mother”).4 Table 3 shows the results by catego - ry of unknown words ( types ) .

The fact that Lemlat does not analyse Roman numbers is not a major concern , as their form is regular , easily predictable and interpretable .
On - ly a few of them can raise ambiguity when writ - ten lowercase .
For instance , vi ( “ six ” ) is homo - graph with the singular ablative of the third de - clension noun vis ( “ power ” ) .
Homography can hold also between items of of the Onomasticon and the original lexical basis of Lemlat .
For instance , the lemma augustus oc - curs both in the original Lemlat ( a first class ad - jective , “ solemn ” ) and in the Onomasticon ( a proper name , “ Augustus ” ) .
If we look at tokens instead of types , coverage rates remain quite similar , as it is shown by Ta - ble 4 .

It is worth noting that , while the text of Virgil shows the highest improvement in type - based evaluation ( +5.7 % ) , Caesar ’s De Bello Gallico is the one that mostly benefits from the extension of Lemlat with the Onomasticon in token - based evaluation ( +6.64 % ) .
This is due to the higher number of occurrences of proper names in Cae - sar than in Virgil .
Indeed , although the number of new word types analysed by LemlatON in comparison to Lemlat is lower for Caesar than for Virgil , the opposite holds when tokens are concerned.6 In more detail , the average number of occurrences ( tokens ) of the new word types analysed by LemlatON for Caesar is 3.59 ( 542/151 ) , while it is 1.71 for Virgil ( 493/288 ) .
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper we described the enhancing of the morphological analyser for Latin Lemlat with a large Onomasticon provided by a reference dic - tionary for Latin ( Forcellini ) .
Although we have included most of the words of the Onomasticon into Lemlat , the work is far from being complete .
Indeed , we have just start - ed to enhance the analyser with graphical vari - ants .
Furthermore , around 2,000 words of the Onomasticon belonging to minor and irregular inflectional classes still have to be included into Lemlat .
Although this promises to be a largely manual and time - consuming work , it is worth doing for achieving the lexicographically moti - vated completeness of the tool ’s lexical basis .
Once completed , the lexical look - up table of the Onomasticon will become part of the overall Lemlat suite , which will be shortly made availa - ble for free download and on - line use .
