Speciﬁcally , we show that human annotation cost can be kept reasonably low , while its quality can be enhanced by machine selfsupervision .
Speciﬁcally , for this goal , we explore the advantage of counterfactual reasoning , over associative reasoning typically used in attention supervision .
Our empirical results show that this machine - augmented human attention supervision is more e  ective than existing methods requiring a higher annotation cost , in text classiﬁcation tasks , including sentiment analysis and news categorization .
1 Introduction The practical importance of attention mechanism has been well - established , for both ( a ) improving NLP models ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) , and also ( b ) enhancing human understanding of models ( Serrano and Smith , 2019 ; Wiegre  e and Pinter , 2019 ) .
This paper pursues the former direction , but unlike existing models , typically using attention in “ unsupervised ” nature .
Adding human supervision to attention has been shown to improve model predictions and explanations ( Jain and Wallace , 2019 ) .
For example , consider a review in ( Tang et al . , 2019 )
“ this place is small and crowded but the service is quick ” .
Models with unsupervised attention may attend highly on “ quick ” , a generic strong signal for restaurant reviews , but one may supervise to focus on “ crowded ” to guide models to predict a negative sentiment correctly .
For this goal , attention supervision task ( Yu et al . , 2017 ; Liu et al . , 2017 ) treats attention as output variables so that models can be trained to generate similar attention to human supervision .
We categorize such human supervision into the following two levels:Sample level rationale :
In the above example , whether to attend on quick orcrowded depends on the ground - truth sentiment class .
Human annotator is required to examine each training sample , and highlight important words speciﬁc to a sample and its class label .
Task level : An alternative with lower annotation overhead would be annotating vocabulary , separately from training samples .
That is , both quick andcrowded are annotated to attend , since both have high importance for the target task of sentiment classiﬁcation .
A naive belief would be assuming the former with a higher annotation cost is more e  ective at supervising the model ’s attention .
Our key claim , in contrast , is that requiring more annotation , or , sample - speciﬁc supervision , can be less e  ective than requiring lessfrom human then augmenting it by machine ( less - is - more -hypothesis ) .
Similar skepticism on asking more , or sample - level rationales from humans , was explored in ( Bao et al . , 2018 ) , where machine attention from large additional annotations was more e  ective supervisions than rationales .
In this paper , we validate less - is - more without additional annotation overhead , by proposing a holistic approach of combining both human annotation and machine attention .
Key distinctions from ( Bao et al . , 2018 ) are ( a ) humans annotate even less , and ( b ) without additional training resources .
Speciﬁcally , we start by loosening the definition of human annotation ( Camburu et al . , 2018 ; Zhong et al . , 2019 ) into the task - level annotation : it reduces annotation cost to the size of vocabulary , or often to zero , when public resources such as sentiment lexicon replace such annotation .
We show the e  ectiveness of this zero - cost supervision , for both sentiment classiﬁcation and news categorization scenarios , after our proposed adaptation .
6696Our adaptation goal is an unsupervised adaptation of task - level human annotation to samplelevel supervision signals for attention /classiﬁcation models .
Speciﬁcally , we propose Sample - level Attentio NAdaptation ( SANA ) .
Speciﬁcally , for self - supervising such adaptation , SANA conducts what - if tests per each sample , of whether the permutation on human annotation changes the machine prediction .
That is , we collect the counterfactual ( machine ) supervisions for free , by observing whether highly attended word by human leads to the same machine prediction , compared to when such attention is counterfactually lowered .
In such a case , SANA supervises to reduce the importance of the word .
We validate such counterfactual signals are missing pieces for adapting word importance to sample - speciﬁc prediction .
We evaluate SANA on three popular datasets , SST2 , IMDB , and 20NG .
In all of the text classiﬁcation datasets , SANA achieves signiﬁcant improvements over baselines , using unsupervised attention or supervised with task- or sample - level human annotations , in the following four dimensions : Models supervised by SANA predict more accurately , explain causality of attention better , and are more robust over adversarial attacks , and more tolerant of the scarcity of training samples .
2 Preliminaries 2.1 Text Classiﬁcation with Attention Text classiﬁcation assumes a dataset D = fxi;yigN i=1 which associates an input text xito its corresponding class label yi .
We will omit the index iwhen dealing with a single input sample .
Let the input sequence of word features ( e.g. , embeddings ) be denoted as x = fwtgT t=1 , where Tis the length of the sequence .
The sequence of hidden states produced by an encoding function f  with learnable parameters  is then h = fhtgT t=1 .
Formally , f  : x!(h;ˆ  ) , where attention weights ˆ  = fˆ  tgT t=1indicate a probability distribution over the hidden states ( Zou et al . , 2018 ; Yang et al . , 2016 ) .
Finally , the hidden representations are fed into a function g : ( h;ˆ  ) !
ˆy with learnable parameters and a softmax layer that predicts the probabilities ˆ yover classes : ˆy = Softmax ( W>˜h+b ) ; =fW;bg ( 1 ) where ˜h = P ht2hˆ  thtand Softmax ( zi)= ezi = P jezj .
The parameters  andare trained to minimize the cross - entropy loss Ltask(ˆy;y ) between the predicted label ˆ yand the ground - truth label y.2.2 Attention Supervision Attention can be treated as output variables , so that humans can supervise .
Given an input sample x , let  andˆ  be the attention labels ( provided by human annotators ) and the trained attention weights .
Then , the loss for attention supervision is deﬁned as the cross - entropy loss Latt(ˆ  ;  ) between ˆ  and  .
Finally , the parameters of the text classiﬁcation network with attention supervision are trained to minimize both loss terms together as follows : L = Ltask(ˆy;y)+Latt ( ˆ  ;  ) ( 2 ) whereis a preference weight .
Requiring humans to explicitly annotate soft labels  has been considered unrealistic ( Barrett et al . , 2018 ) , and often delegated to implicit signals such as eye gaze .
As an alternative to asking humans to annotate , important words for the given sample and class label have been typically annotated as rationale ( Bao et al . , 2018 ; Zhao et
al . , 2018 ) .
Formally , given an input sample xand its class label y , let A2f0;1gTbe a binary vector of selecting words in x , i.e. ,8wt2x : A(wt)2f0;1 g. Then , we convert the attention annotation Ainto a soft distribution of target attention labels  using softmax :  t = exp(A(wt ) )
PT t0=1exp(A(wt0))(3 )
whereis a positive hyper - parameter that controls the variance of scores : when increases , the distribution of  becomes more skewed , guiding to attend a few of more important words .
To illustrate a rationale , when given the aforementioned review sample in Sec . 1 , possible annotations for the negative label are either “ this place is small and crowded but the service is quick ” or “ this place is small and crowded but the service is quick ” , where the underlines indicate the hard selection by human .
Then , we can translate them into the sample - level annotation A=[1;1;1;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0 ] or A= [ 0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0 ] .
3 Less is More for Attention Supervision Sample - level annotation is reportedly too expensive in many practical settings ( Zhong et
al . , 2019 ) , and is far di cult for humans to capture the dependency with corresponding class labels .
In contrast , annotators may select important words for a target task , namely task - level attention annotation
6697(Def . 3.1 ) , without looking up individual samples and their labels .
Deﬁnition 3.1 ( Task - level Attention Annotation )
Assuming the existence of the vocabulary V , the vocab - level annotation Atask2 f0;1gjVjis
a binary vector of the hard selection for words in V , i.e. ,8wt2V : Atask(wt)2 f0;1 g. Based onAtask , when given an input sample x , we can use a proxy of the sample - level annotation A , i.e. , 8wt2x : A(wt)=Atask(wt ) .
Sample - level Task - level Reduction ratio SST2 208 K 16 K -92.3 % IMDB 5 M 124 K
-97.5 % 20NG 232 K 22 K -90.5 % Table 1 : Comparison of annotation space As shown in Tab . 1 , the annotation space , which is referred to as a word set size for annotation , is 1036 times smaller at task - level than at samplelevel .
Generally , the vocabulary size is far smaller than the total number of word occurrences in training samples .
Our goal is thus to keep annotation cost cognitively reasonable ( Zou et al . , 2018 ; Zhao et
al . , 2018 ) , leaving machine self - supervision to close the annotation quality gap ( Sec . 3.1 and 3.2 ) .
Meanwhile , we present a setup of zero - cost supervision , which allows us attention supervision without any human e  orts in all scenarios using public resources and tools ( Sec . 3.3 ) .
3.1 Counterfactuals as Causal Signals Our key idea is to leverage causal signals ( Johansson et al . , 2016 ) from human annotation A(or attention labels  ) of an input sample xto its corresponding model prediction ˆy .
More speciﬁcally , we test whether two di  erent attentions ( one is original and the other is counterfactual ) on the same input sample xlead to di  erent prediction results ˆy .
If high ( original ) and low ( counterfactual ) attention weights for an word wtyield the same ( or very similar ) prediction , it provides evidence to edit the importance of word wtinAinto a lower value .
Formally , let ˆ  and ¯  be the original and counterfactual attention weights , respectively , and let ˆyand¯ytbe the original prediction and its counterfactual prediction with attention change ( i.e. , from ˆ  tto¯  t ) on wt2x , respectively .
Then , knowing the quantityjˆy ¯ytj , measured as the individualized treatment e  ect ( ITE ) , enables measuring howAlgorithm 1 SANA Input : Training dataset D , Task - level annotation A Output : Model parameters f  ; g

For this measurement , we adopt the Total Variance Distance ( Jain and Wallace , 2019 ) between the two predictions , which is deﬁned as follows : TVD ( ˆy;¯yt)=1 2CX c=1jˆyc ¯yc tj ( 4 ) where cis the class index .
If TVD value is too low , we can give a penalty by decaying the human annotation A(wt ) with a factor of  , which we empirically set as 0.5 , to update the attention labels .
3.2 Sample - level Attention Adaptation Based on TVD , we propose a simple yet e  ective approach , Sample - level Attentio NAdaptation ( SANA ) , to derive the sample - level machine attention from the task - level human annotation .
As described in Alg . 1 , SANA starts with the classiﬁcation model trained with the initial attention labels  .
Based on  and , we run the classiﬁcation inference several times for an input sample : one for obtaining the original attention weights ˆ   and the others for counterfactual attention weights ¯  .
More speciﬁcally , we ﬁrst store the hidden representations hand the attention weights ˆ  from f  , and the original prediction ˆy .
Then , for each
6698word wt , Counterfactuals returns the counterfactual attention weights ¯  , by 1 ) copying ˆ  but 2 ) assigning zero to the t - th dimension and 3 ) renormalizing as probability distribution , and we obtain its corresponding prediction result ¯ytby re - using h. Note that , since the hidden representation at time step tcontextualizes a word wtwith surrounding words , we adopt perturbing only single words in SANA , not multiple words at the same time , also enjoying the computational advantage .
Finally , based on ˆyand¯yt , as deﬁned in Eq ( 4 ) , we compute TVD and update the human annotation Aby threshold and decay ratio  .
Once an iteration1is completed over the whole training corpus , we re
- train the network with the updated attention annotation and labels .
For the stable update , we observe that increasing the coe cientin
Eq ( 3 ) is crucial , as TVD is not an optimal metric , preventing  from being ﬂattened .
3.3 Zero - cost Supervision From this point on , for task - level supervision , we assume zero - cost human annotation e  orts , either by using public resources or self - supervision .
Supervision by public resources Task - level annotation are often publicly available as resources or tools .
For example , sentiment lexicon ( Esuli and Sebastiani , 2006 ) consists of sentiment words , which are important to the sentiment classiﬁcation task , and named - entity recognizer ( NER ) ( Peters et al . , 2017 ) can collect entity words commonly attended in news categorization task .
We empirically show that both lexicon and NER can be adequate substitutes for the manual task - level annotation .
Model distillation In an extreme scenario without any human annotator and public resources , inspired by self knowledge distillation ( Furlanello et al . , 2018 ) , we report results for using the attention weights of the unsupervised model as a supervision .
Note , however , this is highly unlikely in practice , but reported as a lower bound accuracy , when unsupervised attention noise is propagated through distillation supervision .
Using SANA is even more critical in this noisy annotation scenario , to denoise attention supervision from counterfactual reasoning , which we empirically analyze this in the subsequent section .
1O(jDjT ) , where Tis the maximum sequence length4
Experiment Setup 4.1 Datasets To validate the e  ectiveness of SANA , we use the following three text classiﬁcation datasets , which are widely used ( Wang et al . , 2018 ; Jain and Wallace , 2019 ) and statistically diverse as well .
We split the o cial training split into 90 % and 10 % as training and validation sets respectively .
We expect SANA in two - sentence tasks , such as SNLI and MPQA , would be promising , which we leave as future work .
SST2 ( Socher et al . , 2013 ): Stanford Sentiment Treebank provides around 11 K sentences tagged with sentiment on a scale from 1 ( most negative ) to 5 ( most positive ) .
We ﬁlter out neutral samples and dichotomize the remaining sentences into positive ( 4,5 ) and negative ( 1,2 ) .
We set the maximum sequence length as 30 .
IMDB ( Maas et
al . , 2011 ): IMDB Large Movie Review Corpus is a binary sentiment classiﬁcation dataset containing 50 K polarized ( positive or negative ) movie reviews , split into half for training and testing .
We set the maximum sequence length as 180 .
20NG : 20 Newsgroups2contains around 19 K documents evenly categorized into 20 di  erent categories .
Following ( Jain and Wallace , 2019 ) , we extract samples belonging to baseballandhockey classes , which we designate as 0 and 1 , deriving a binary classiﬁcation task ( Hockey vs Baseball ) .
We set the maximum sequence length as 300 .
4.2 Implementation Details For all datasets , we use skip - gram ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) ( o cial GoogleNews - vectors - negative300 ) word embeddings with 300 dimensions .
We use 1layered GRU for each direction with hidden size of 150 for both SST2 and IMDB , and 300 for 20NG dataset , with gof 300 dimension with 0.5 dropout rate .
For attention mechanism , the size of trainable context vector is set to 100 for SST2 and 300 for IMDB and 20NG .
For attention supervision , we use the balancing coecient=1:0 for SST2 and IMDB , and = 2:0 for 20NG .
Contrary to Zou et
al .
( 2018 ) , we 2http://qwone.com/ ~jason/20Newsgroups/
6699observe a larger is more e  ective for the smaller dataset .
We set the contrasting coe cient=3 except=5 for 20NG dataset .
In Alg . 1 , we use decay ratio  = 2:0 and TVD threshold =0:3 .
In our experiments , the decay ratio is not signiﬁcantly correlated with the ﬁnal accuracy , but correlated more with the convergence period .
Setting  = 2:0 leads to the reported performance within zmax=5 .
For BERT , we train BERT - base architecture with a batch size of 4 over 3 epochs .
We used Adam with a learning rate of 6.25e-5 and PiecewiseLinear scheduler .
All parameters are optimized until convergence , using Adam optimizer of learning rate 0 : 001 .
The learning parameters were chosen by the best performance on the validation set .
In Alg . 1 , the models are additionally ﬁne - tuned over 10 epochs for each iteration .
Note that learning time longer than our setting does not contribute to improving the model accuracy .
5 Results and Discussion We now proceed to empirically validate the e  ectiveness of SANA , compared to unsupervised attention , and attention supervision approaches using either task - level or sample - level annotations as baselines ( shortly , unsupervised , task - level , and sample ) .
For task - level annotations ( e.g. , in SANA ) , we adopt pre - annotated task - level annotations without any additional human e  orts : for the two sentiment tasks , we use SentiWordNet ( Esuli and Sebastiani , 2006 ) , and for 20NG task , we use entities recognized by AllenNLP NER ( Peters et al . , 2017 ) .
We thus present the empirical ﬁndings for the following four research questions : RQ1 : Does SANA improve model accuracy ?
RQ2 : Does SANA improve model robustness ?
RQ3 : Is SANA e  ective for data - scarce cases ?
RQ4 : Does SANA improve attention explainability ?
5.1 RQ1 : Classiﬁcation Accuracy
The main objective of this work is to improve attention supervisions for the purpose of better text classiﬁcation .
Thus , we evaluate the three attention methods by their contribution to the classiﬁcation performance .
Tab . 2 shows the classiﬁcation accuracy for three classiﬁcation datasets .
In the table , we can observe the proposed approach , SANA with task - level annotation , outperforms all baselines in all the datasets .
Among the results , Accuracy SST2 IMDB 20NG BERT 91.67 94.10 93.25 unsupervised BiGRU 83.96 88.07 86.04 model distillation BiGRU 83.53 86.93 85.12 + SANA 84.35 88.03 88.23 task - level annotation BiGRU 85.12 89.30 87.19 + SANA 85.72 90.10 89.13 Table 2 : Classiﬁcation Performance : accuracy ( % ) on the three classiﬁcation datasets .
SANA achieves the largest improvement over in 20NG dataset , which has the smallest training data .
This suggests that SANA can also provide e  ective attention supervisions in data - scarce environments .
To discuss this issue further , we will repeat this comparison over the varying size of training data for RQ3 .
Our study also conﬁrms two additional observations to our advantage – counterfactual 1 ) is e  ective even in model distillation setting and 2 ) meaningfully contributes to performance gains .
More speciﬁcally , 1 ) SANA achieves 84.35 % in SST2 dataset which is higher than the distillation only model , but lower than task - level supervised model .
2 ) this model gets 88.23 % in 20NG dataset , which outperforms even task - level supervised model with 1.04 point gains .
This also suggests the limitation of model distillation as supervision signals and supervision by public resources can provide better initial point for SANA than model distillation .
Our key contribution is to show zero - cost attention supervision can improve a simple model closer to a highly sophisticated model , such as BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) requiring more layers and data .
This motivates us to supervise attention for BERT , though understanding of BERT internals , such as ( Rogers et al . , 2020 ) , is mostly observational at this stage – Intervening with attention would be an interesting future work .
Our experimental results show that SANA works well in diverse scenarios , but we observe that the e  ectiveness is reduced when the length of target text increases ( Figure 2 ) or token identiﬁability decreases ( e.g. , complex architecture ): SANA more
6700e  ectively works when the token identiﬁability is improved ( by adding residual connection between two recurrent layers ) , achieving 0.83 point gain from 89.14 % , which is larger gap than 0.47 point gain without residual connection .
5.2 RQ2 : Robustness in Adversarial Attacks Having tested for the overall performance with the original datasets , we evaluate the robustness of SANA with the the adversarial datasets .
Recently , adversarial examples ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) have been employed as an evaluation tool for model robustness : while the adversarial example conveys very similar semantics of its original sample , but with small and intentional feature perturbations to cause classiﬁcation models to make false predictions .
For robustness analysis , we thus test whether the attention models can keep the original predictions from adversarial examples .
This experiment consists of the following steps : First , based on the original training data , we set a basic BiGRU model ( without attention mechanism ) as threat model , which an adversarial attack method aims to deceive .
Second , based on the original test data , we generate paraphrase texts by using the state - of - the - art attack method ( Alzantot et al . , 2018 ) with word - level perturbations .
Third , we randomly select almost 500 paraphrase texts , which succeed in changing the prediction of threat model , i.e. , adversarial examples .
Finally , we report the accuracy of the three attention models over both adversarial examples and their corresponding original samples , respectively .
Tab .
3 presents the results of adversarial attacks.3 In the table , we can ﬁnd that SANA is more robust , showing the smallest gap of the classiﬁcation accuracy between the original and adversarial samples .
It demonstrates that , when the network is attending to the words having causal signals to the model prediction , the network becomes more robust against adversarial attacks , which is consistent with the experimental results in Lai et al .
( 2019 ) .
In addition to that , we observe similar results against the white - box adversarial examples ( Tsai et al . , 2019 ) , where SANA improves 3.20 and 1.80 point gains from both unsupervised and supervised attentions .
3The reason why “ Original ” is di  erent from natural accuracy in Tab . 2 is that we conduct the experiments over the original samples only paired with the adversarial examples , incurring the biases in the test set .
Figure 1 : Sample E  ectiveness : accuracy ( % ) on varying the amount of training samples in IMDB dataset .
5.3 RQ3 : Sample E  ectiveness This section compares models over the varying amount of training samples in IMDB dataset , as a stress test for data - scarce scenarios .
For this experiment , we collect the samplespeciﬁc annotations from human workers .
First , we randomly select 500 training samples from IMDB dataset , and ask the worker to underline the apparent rationales for the sentiment class , guided by the deﬁnition of rationale in Zhang
et al .
( 2016 )
.
The data collection is conducted using an open annotation tool ( Yang et al . , 2018 ) .
Then , we build an additional method , named sample , which is trained with the collected sample - speciﬁc annotations .
The results are presented in Fig .
1 .
We notice that SANA and sample show much stronger performance when the training data is scarce , where similar results are reported in ( Bao et al . , 2018 ) .
As we expected , the attention supervision using the sample - speciﬁc annotations gets a higher accuracy than that using the task - level annotations , but can not be scaled - up above 500 training samples , which is represented by the red reference line .
In contrast , SANA improves accuracy with 1000 samples and its scalability .
This result demonstrates that our counterfactual inferences successfully augment one annotation into multiple ( counterfactual ) attention supervisions , better regularizing from limited samples .
5.4 RQ4 : Attention as Human Explanation
This section studies whether attention , after supervision , is more e  ective for human consumption as model explanation .
Existing metrics for explainability measure whether attention correlates with ( a ) class prediction or ( b ) feature importance , discussed in the next sections respectively .
6701SST2 IMDB 20NG Original Adversarial jj Original Adversarial jj Original Adversarial jj unsupervised 47.2 47.8 0.6 68.8 64.1 4.7 47.7 48.3 0.6 task - level 50.3 48.3 2.1 69.2 65.0 4.1 48.7 48.2 0.5 task - level + SANA ( Ours ) 49.9 49.7 0.2 69.4 65.2 4.1 48.1 48.3 0.2 Table 3 : Adversarial Attack : accuracy ( % ) for original and adversarial examples on the three classiﬁcation dataset .
Against the adversarial attacks , the proposed method SANA shows consistent performance with the smallest accuracy gap ( jj ) over all the datasets .
For this evaluation , we use 485 , 532 , and 478 pairs of original samples and adversarial examples , in SST2 , IMDB , and 20NG respectively .
5.4.1 Attention as Causal Explanation One measure for the explainability of attention is whether each attention weight captures the causality of word and class prediction , by permuting words and observing prediction changes .
If the learning is successful , such causal signals should be consistently observed in the test predictions .
To validate this , we employ the attention - permutation experiments designed in ( Jain and Wallace , 2019 ) , i.e. ,what - if simulation .
Speciﬁcally , when given an input sample in the test phase , we look into whether the randomly mutated attention ( i.e. , cause ) from the original attention yields any changes in the corresponding prediction result ( i.e. , e  ect ) .
Here , TVD for the permutation can be regarded as a desirable evaluation measure : as TVD is lower , the ( original ) learned attention has a weak mapping with the model prediction , and vice versa .
The results are presented in Fig .
2 , where x - axis refers to TVD values , i.e. , the di  erence of model predictions , and y - axis refers to the frequency of what - if simulations on their returning TVD value .
To carefully analyze this , we divide the simulation results by four di  erent intervals of input sequence length , which can be an inﬂuencing factor : as the perturbations on longer texts are unlikely to make prediction changes ( Sen et al . , 2020 ) .
In this ﬁgure , we can observe that SANA has the lowest frequency on TVD = 0 in all cases , showing the distribution skewed to larger TVD ( i.e. , right on x - axis ) compared to baselines .
Such distribution suggests that attention in SANA strongly a  ects model prediction by the causal signals .
In unsupervised andvocab ( i.e. , task - level ) , the distributions are skewed to lower TVD ( i.e. , left on x - axis ) , having larger frequency on zero TVD than SANA .
These patterns indicate the baselines have weak attentions loosely aligned to model predictions , motivating SANA even working well in long texts.5.4.2
Attention as Importance Indicator As an alternative metric of attention explainablity , ( Jain and Wallace , 2019 ) considers the relationship between attention weights and gradient - based feature importance score of each word .
However , prior research suggests using word as a unit of importance feature is rather artiﬁcial , as word is contextualized by , and interacts with other words : ( Wiegre  e and Pinter , 2019 ) observes such limitation , and
Shapley ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) measures interaction between features for capturing dependency of arbitrary subsets .
For this purpose , we report the KL divergence between C - Shapley4and attention weights , DKL(Shapley ( x)jjattention ( x ) ) .
We present the results in Tab . 4 , showing SANA approach is the most well correlated method with Shapley scores , well capturing word dependency .
unsupervised task - level SANA IMDB 52.62 12.69 8.86 Table 4 : KL - divergence from C - Shapley Intuitively , C - Shapley observes the interaction in n - gram , and our work , attending upon hidden representations of RNN , which are softn - grams , captures similar interactions .
This result manifests that , standing on self - supervision signals , our counterfactual process can improve the explanation on the contextualization ability of RNN architectures .
6 Related Work Instead of treating attention as a by - product of model training , the following work explored how machine /human can consume attention for model improvement or explanation , respectively .
Machine /human may also provide supervision .
We thus categorize existing work by machine /human 4https://github.com/Jianbo-Lab/LCShapley

Our work falls into human providing supervision ( with machine augmenting supervision ) for machine consumption .
6.1 Attention to /from
Human As for human consuming attention as explanation , there has been criticism that unsupervised attention weights are too poorly correlated with the contribution of each word for machine decision ( or , unfaithful ) ( Jain and Wallace , 2019 ; Serrano and Smith , 2019 ; Pruthi et al . , 2019 ) .
Meanwhile , ( Wiegre  e and Pinter , 2019 ) develops diagnostics to decide when attention is good enough as explanation .
As for improving human consumption , one direction focuses on better aligning models to human , another on improving annotation quality .
First , identiﬁability ( Brunner et al . , 2020 ) explains human - machine discrepancy , where tokenlevel information is lost in model hidden states .
For better alignment , ( Tutek and ˇSnajder , 2020 ) utilizes masked language model ( MLM ) loss and ( Mohankumar et al . , 2020 ) invents orthogonal LSTM representations .
Second , toward the direction of improving annotation , ( Barrett et al . , 2018 ; Zhong et al . , 2019 ; Bao et al . , 2018 ) adopts sample - speciﬁc human annotations .
In addition to rationales , ( Zhao et al . , 2018 ) uses event trigger words and ( Kim and Kim , 2018 ) leverages user authenticated domains to narrow down the scope of attentions .
( Strubell et al . , 2018 ) injects word dependency relations to recognize the semantic roles in text .
Such annotation overhead can be replaced by existing pre - annotated resources : ( Zou et al . , 2018 ) considers sentiment lexicon dictionary for a related task .
We pursue the second direction , but without incurring additional human annotation , by exploring the counterfactual augmentation , originated from self - supervision signals , contributing towards both accuracy and robustness of the model .
6.2 Attention to /from
Machine Machine consuming attention for higher accuracy is the most classical target scenario .
( Yang et al . , 2016 ) proposes hierarchical attention for document classiﬁcation , ( Chen et al . , 2016 ) personalizes classiﬁcation to user and product attributes .
( Margatina et al . , 2019 ) incorporates knowledge information to the self - attention module , i.e. , lexicon features .
Alternatively , machine may mine or augment attention supervision : ( Tang et al . , 2019 ) automatically mines attention supervision by masking - out
6703highly attentive words in a progressive manner .
( Choi et al . , 2019 ) augments counterfactual observations to debias human attention supervision via instance similarity .
Our work is of combining the strength of the two works : we automatically improve attention supervision via self - supervision signals , but we build it with free task - level resources .
7 Conclusion & Future Work
We studied the problem of attention supervision , and showed that requiring sample - level human supervision is often less e  ective than task - level alternative with lower ( and often zero- ) overhead .
Speciﬁcally , we proposed a counterfactual signal for self - supervision , to augment task - level human annotation , into sample - level machine attention supervision , to increase both the accuracy and robustness of the model .
We hope future research to explore scenarios where human intuition is not working as well as text classiﬁcation , such as graph attention (
