Abstract This paper proposes a new method of instance - based domain adaptation for sentiment analysis .
First , our method deﬁnes the likelihood of keywords , through the value of inverse document frequency ( IDF ) , for each word in documents in the target domain .
Next , the keyword content rate of a document is calculated using the likelihood of keywords and the domain adaptation is performed by giving the keyword content rate to each document in the source domain as the weight .
The experiment used an Amazon dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method .
Although the instance - based method has not shown great efﬁciency , the advantages combining instance - based method and feature - based method are shown in this paper .
1 Introduction This paper proposes a new method of instance - based domain adaptation for sentiment analysis .
Sentiment analysis involves judging a polarity , positive or negative , of a review such as a movie review .
This is one of the document classiﬁcation tasks and supervised learning can be used to solve it .
However , if the domain of the test data is different from the domain for the learning data ( for example , book reviews ) , the accuracy of the classiﬁer obtained through standard supervised learning reduced .
This is the problem with domain shift .
The solution to this problem is domain adaptation .
Domain adaptation can be roughly divided into two categories : feature - based and instance - based ( Panand Yang , 2010 ) .
In summary , both are weightedlearning methods , but feature - based gives weights to features and instance - based gives weight to instance .
Here , we present a new instance - based method .
Generally , the instance - based method assumes a covariate shift , and gives the weight based on the probability density ratio between target domain and source domain .
However , the computational cost for the instance - based method is too high .
The method presented here is simple and its effect is better than methods using a typical probability density ratio .
Our method ﬁrst deﬁnes lw , the likelihood of the keyword of the word wusing the IDF in the target domain .
Using lw , the weight of a review xin the source domain is set as the keyword content rate wx .
After that , weighted - learning is performed by givingwxto each document in the source domain xto overcome the domain shift .
In the experiment , we used Amazon dataset ( Blitzer et al . , 2007 ) , and compared our proposed method with two typical instance - based methods : unconstrained least squares importance ﬁtting ( uLSIF ) ( Yamada et al . , 2011 ) using the probability density ratio and the method deﬁning weight through Naive Bayes model ( Shinnou and Sasaki , 2014 ) , to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method .
2 Related Work Domain adaptation is roughly divided into two types : the supervised approach using labeled data in the target domain and the unsupervised approach that does not use them .
For supervised approach , Daum ´ e ’s method ( Daum ´ e III , 2007 ) has become a PACLIC 32 37   32nd Pacific Asia Conference on Language , Information and Computation   Hong Kong , 1 - 3 December 2018

standard method because of its simplicity and high ability .
The method in the current research is an unsupervised approach .
Unsupervised approaches can further be divided into two types : feature - based and instance - based ( Pan and Yang , 2010 ) .
They are both weighted learning methods ; feature - based methods give weights to features and instance - based methods give weights to instances .
Among featurebased methods , the most representative method is structural correspondence learning ( SCL ) ( Blitzer et al . , 2006 ) .
In addition , CORAL ( Sun et al . , 2016 ) has attracted much attention for its simplicity and high ability in recent years .
Moreover , the feature - based methods with deep learning ( Glorot et al . , 2011 ) , the expanded CORAL ( Sun and Saenko , 2016 ) and adversarial networks ( Ganin and Lempitsky , 2015)(Tzeng et al . , 2017 ) are also considered as the state of the art .
On the other hand , instance - based methods have not been studied as much as feature - based methods .
The instance - based method assumes a covariate shift .
A covariate shift assumes PS(cjx ) = PT(cjx ) andPS(x )
= PT(x ) .
Under a covariate shift , PT(cjx ) can be obtained by the weighted learning that uses the probability density ratio r= PT(x)=P
S(x)as the weight of the document of the source data
x.
There are a variety of methods for calculating the probability density ratio .
The simplest way to calculate the ratio is directly estimate PS(x)andPT(x ) , but in the case of complex models , the problem will be more complicated .
Thus , the method that directly models the probability density ratio was studied .
Among these methods , uLSIF ( Yamada et al . , 2011 ) is widely used because the time complexity of the method is relatively small .
However , P(x)of bag - of - words can be modeled by Naive Bayes model if the problem is limited to natural language processing .
Therefore , ( Shinnou and Sasaki , 2014 ) deﬁned Pr(x ) , the prior of x , as follows : PR(x )
= ∏n i=1PR(fi ) , where xdenotes a data in the domain Randxhas a set of features , that is , x = ff1 ; f2;   ; fng .
They also obtain PR(fi ) using the following equation : PR(f )
= n(R;f ) +1 N(R)+2 .
Here , n(R;f)is the frequency of feature fin the domain R , and n(R)is the number of data in the domain R. Therefore , the probability density ratiois obtained as follows : r = PT(x ) PS(x)=n(T ; f ) + 1 N(T ) + 2N(S ) + 2 n(S ; f ) + 1(1 ) 3 Proposed Method 3.1 Likelihood of the Keyword in the Target Domain The likelihood of the keyword in the target domain islx , and lxis set as the value of IDF in the target domain of w : lx= log(N di ) + 1 Here Nis the number of articles in the article collection in the target domain , and diis the number of articles containing the word win the article collection in the target domain .

Using these , wx is given by the following equation : wx=1∑k i=1fiK∑ i=1filwi 4 Experiment The Amazon dataset ( Blitzer et al . , 2007 ) used in the experiment is speciﬁcally developed using the processed_acl.tar.gz ﬁle on the following website .

In addition , IDEAL is a result using the training data in the target domain to learn through the classiﬁer and apply it to the test data in the target domain .
Using the case as a weighted method , a compari1http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto _ examples / svm / plot_weighted_samples.htmlson of uLSIF , NB , the our method shows that the six highest correct answer rates in the 12 domain adaptations are obtained by our method , and the remaining six highest positive answer rates are obtained by NB .
When we take 12 averages , the solution rate of our method is more than that of NB , and our method is weighted with example and , which is excellent .
5 Discussion NONE in Table1 is compared with the case weighting method ( uLSIF , NB , and our method ) .
It is clear that NONE has a high positive solution rate .
For theae data only , the instance - based method has no effect on domain adaptation .
However , feature - based and instance - based methods are easy to combine .
Here , the four domains applied in paper ( Sun et al . , 2016 ) are adapted to B ˠE , DˠB , EˠKandKˠD , and SCL conversion training is used ﬁrst .
The prime vector of the data , then experiment with the weighted - learning in this transformed vector is performed using the proposed method .
The results are shown in Table 3 .
The CORAL in Table 3 is taken from ( Sun et al . , 2016 ) .
From Table 3,it can be seen that SCL has no effect .
After SCL is combined with our method , the accuracy is not high enough .
However , when SCL is combined with the proposed method , the precision for SCL alone is improved .

Figure 1 : AE+NN+Weighted - Learning the combined the instance - based and feature - based methods can be conﬁrmed .
There are many ways in useing the feature - based method , in addition to SCL , so it can be improved by combining these techniques with the proposed method .
In addition , although the weighted - learning SVM is used in this paper , the loss value of the loss function in the neural network is multiplied by the weight , and it is easier to realize weighted - learning as the loss value .
There are many options for using the domain adaptation method on deep learning , and these solutions combined with instance - based are easier to compute .
In a simple example , we used the AutoEncoder ( AE ) as the feature - based method .
Using AE , the dimension of the data in the source and target domain was reduced , that is , encoded .
In learning and testing , we used the connected data of the orig - inal data and the encoded data instead of the original data .
In learning , as described above , the value of the loss function was multiplied by the weight obtained by our method and was taken as the loss valueʢFIG . 1ʣ .
Only the experiment of BˠE is performed , and the results in Table 4 ͱFIG . 2 were obtained .
In addition , in this experiment , neural network learning was ended in 50 epochs , and the correct rate was the result from evaluating the model obtained by learning data after 50 epochs .
Moreover , the dimension was reduced to 200 .
Every method used the same multi - layer perceptron , which has three layers .
The use of the connected data of the original data and the encoded data is a feature - based method .
FIG .
2 shows that this feature - based method NN+AE improves the precision of the standard neural network NN .

and our method further improves it .
This result shows that the combination of the featurebased method and the instance - based method is easy in network learning and effective .
In the future , we are planning to design a domain adaptation method in this framework .
6 Conclusion This paper proposed a method for instance - based domain adaptation of sentiment analysis .
For outline , from the target domain , using IDF to set the likelihood of keywords , and the data in the source domain , the content rate in the target domain keyword , and the keyword content rate as the weight .
In the experiment , we compared our proposed method with two typical instance - based methods : uLSI using the probability density ratio and the method deﬁning weight through Naive Bayes model .
However , using an instance - based alone to perform domain adaptation has a very small effect , the combining instance - based method and feature - based method is assured as shown in this paper .
Further , the combination is easy to implement in the neural network model .
Thus , we will investigate this approach in future .
