c  2021 Association for Computational Linguistics8862MLEC - QA : A Chinese Multi - Choice Biomedical Question Answering Dataset Jing Li , Shangping Zhong andKaizhi Chen College of Computer and Data Science , Fuzhou University , Fuzhou , China { N190320027 , spzhong , ckz}@fzu.edu.cn Abstract Question Answering ( QA ) has been successfully applied in scenarios of human - computer interaction such as chatbots and search engines .
However , for the speciﬁc biomedical domain , QA systems are still immature due to expert - annotated datasets being limited by category and scale .
In this paper , we present MLEC - QA , the largest - scale Chinese multi - choice biomedical QA dataset , collected from the National Medical Licensing Examination in China .
The dataset is composed of ﬁve subsets with 136,236 biomedical multi - choice questions with extra materials ( images or tables ) annotated by human experts , and ﬁrst covers the following biomedical sub-ﬁelds : Clinic , Stomatology , Public Health , Traditional Chinese Medicine , and Traditional Chinese Medicine Combined with Western Medicine .
We implement eight representative control methods and open - domain QA methods as baselines .
Experimental results demonstrate that even the current best model can only achieve accuracies between 40 % to 55 % on ﬁve subsets , especially performing poorly on questions that require sophisticated reasoning ability .
We hope the release of the MLEC - QA dataset can serve as a valuable resource for research and evaluation in open - domain QA , and also make advances for biomedical QA systems.1 1 Introduction As a branch of the QA task , Biomedical Question Answering ( BQA ) enables effectively perceiving , accessing , and understanding complex biomedical knowledge by innovative applications , which makes BQA an important QA application in the biomedical domain ( Jin et al . , 2021 ) .
Such a task has recently attracted considerable attention from the NLP community ( Zweigenbaum , 2003 ; He et al . , 2020b ; Jin et al . , 2020 ) , but is still confronted with the following three key challenges : 1https://github.com/Judenpech/MLEC-QA(1 ) Most work attempt to build BQA systems with deep learning and neural network techniques ( Ben Abacha et al . , 2017 , 2019b ; Pampari et
al . , 2018 ) and are thus data - hungry .
However , annotating large - scale biomedical question - answer pairs with high quality is prohibitively expensive .
As a result , current expert - annotated BQA datasets are small in size .
( 2 ) Multi - choice QA is a typical format type of BQA dataset .
Most previous work focus on such format type of datasets in which contents are in the ﬁeld of clinical medicine ( Zhang et al . , 2018b ; Jin et al . , 2020 ) and consumer health ( Zhang et al . , 2017 , 2018a ; He et al . , 2019 ; Tian et al . , 2019 ) .
However , there are many other specialized sub-ﬁelds in biomedicine that have not been studied before ( e.g. , Stomatology ) .
( 3 ) Ideal BQA systems should not only focus on raw text data , but also fully utilize various types of biomedical resources , such as images and tables .
Unfortunately , most BQA datasets are either texts ( Tsatsaronis et al . , 2015 ; Pampari et al . , 2018 ; Jin et al . , 2019 ) or images ( Lau et al . , 2018 ; Ben Abacha et al . , 2019a ; He et al . , 2020a ) ; as a result , BQA datasets that are composed by fusing different biomedical resources are relatively limited .
To push forward the variety of BQA datasets , we present MLEC - QA , the largest - scale Chinese multi - choice BQA dataset .
Questions in MLECQA are collected from the National Medical Licensing Examination in China ( NMLEC ) 2 , which are carefully designed by human experts to evaluate professional knowledge and skills for those who want to be medical practitioners in China .
The NMLEC has a total number of 24 categories of exams , but only ﬁve of them have the written exams in Chinese .
Every year , only around 18 - 22 % of applicants can pass one of these exams , showing the complexity and difﬁculty of passing 2http://www.nmec.org.cn/Pages/ArticleList-12-0-01.html
8863them even for skilled humans .
There are three main properties of MLEC - QA : ( 1 ) MLEC - QA is the largest - scale Chinese multichoice BQA dataset , containing 136,236 questions with extra materials ( images or tables ) , Table 1 shows an example .
( 2 ) MLEC - QA ﬁrst covers the following biomedical sub-ﬁelds : Clinic , Stomatology , Public Health , Traditional Chinese Medicine , and Traditional Chinese Medicine Combined with Western Medicine ( denoted as Chinese Western Medicine ) .
Only one ( Clinic ) of them has been studied in previous research .
( 3 ) MLEC - QA provides extra labels of ﬁve question types ( A1 , A2 , A3 / A4 and B1 ) for each question , and an in - depth analysis of the most frequent reasoning types of the questions in MLEC - QA , such as lexical matching , multi - sentence reading and concept summary , etc .
Detailed analysis can be found in Section 3.2 .
Examples of sub-ﬁelds and question types are summarized in Table 2 .
We set each example of ﬁve question types corresponding to one of the subﬁelds due to page limits .

As an attempt to solve MLEC - QA and provide strong baselines , we implement eight representative control methods and open - domain QA methods by a two - stage retriever - reader framework : ( 1 ) A retriever ﬁnding documents that ( might ) contain an answer from a large collection of documents .
We adopt Chinese Wikipedia dumps3as our information sources , and use a distributed search and 3https://dumps.wikimedia.org/analytics engine , ElasticSearch4 , as the document store and document retriever .
( 2 ) A reader ﬁnding the answer in given documents retrieved by the retriever .
We ﬁne - tune ﬁve pre - trained language models for machine reading comprehension as the reader .
Experimental results show that even the current best model can only achieve accuracies of 53 % , 44 % , 40 % , 55 % , and 50 % on the ﬁve categories of subsets : Clinic , Stomatology , Public Health , Traditional Chinese Medicine , and Chinese Western Medicine , respectively .
The models especially perform poorly on questions that require understanding comprehensive biomedical concepts and handling complex reasoning .

•We implement eight representative methods as baselines and show the performance of existing methods on MLEC - QA , and provide an outlook for future research directions .
2 Related Work Open - Domain BQA The Text REtrieval Conference ( TREC ) ( Voorhees and Tice , 2000 ) has triggered the open - domain BQA research .
At the time , most traditional BQA systems were employing complex pipelines with question processing , document / passage retrieval , and answer processing modules .
Examples of such systems include EPoCare ( Niu et al . , 2003 ) , MedQA ( Yu et al . , 2007 ;
Terol et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ) and AskHERMES ( Cao et al . , 2011 ) .
With the introduction of various BQA datasets that are focused on speciﬁc biomedical topics , such as BioASQ ( Tsatsaronis et al . , 2015 ) , emrQA ( Pampari et al . , 2018 ) and PubMedQA ( Jin et al . , 2019 ) , pioneered by Chen et al .
( 2017 ) , the modern open - domain BQA systems largely simpliﬁed the traditional BQA pipeline to a two - stage retriever - reader framework by combining information retrieval and machine reading comprehension models ( Ben Abacha et al . , 2017 , 2019b ) .
Moreover , the extensive use of medical images ( e.g. , CT ) and tables ( e.g. , laboratory examination ) has improved results in real - world clinical scenarios , making the BQA a task lying at the intersection of Computer Vision ( CV ) and NLP .
However , most BQA models focus on either texts or images ( Lau et al . , 2018 ; Ben Abacha et al . , 2019a ; He et al . , 2020a )
; as a result , BQA datasets that are composed by fusing different biomedical resources are relatively limited .
Open - Domain Multi - Choice BQA Datasets With rapidly increasing numbers of consumers asking health - related questions on online medical consultation websites , cMedQA ( Zhang et
al . , 2017 , 2018a ) , webMedQA ( He et al . , 2019 ) and ChiMed ( Tian et al . , 2019 ) exploit patient - doctor QA data to build consumer health QA datasets .
However , the quality problems in such datasets are that the answers are written by online - doctors andthe data itself has intrinsic noise .
By contrast , medical licensing examinations , which are designed by human medical experts , often take the form of multi - choice questions , and contain a signiﬁcant number of questions that require comprehensive biomedical knowledge and multiple reasoning ability .
Such exams are the perfect data source to push the development of BQA systems .
Several datasets have been released that exploit such naturally existing BQA data , which are summarized in Table 3 .
Collecting from the Spain public healthcare specialization examination , HEAD - QA ( Vilares and Gómez - Rodríguez , 2019 ) contains multichoice questions from six biomedical categories , including Medicine , Pharmacology , Psychology , Nursing , Biology and Chemistry .
NLPEC ( Li et al . , 2020 ) collects 21.7k multi - choice questions with human - annotated answers from the National Licensed Pharmacist Examination in China , but only a small number of sample data is available for public use .
Last but not least , clinical medicine , as one of the 24 categories in NMLEC , has been previously studied by MedQA ( Zhang et al . , 2018b ) and MEDQA ( Jin et al . , 2020 ) .
However , the former did not release any data or code , and the latter only focused on clinical medicine with 34k questions in their cross - lingual studies , questions with images or tables were not included , and none of the remaining categories in MLEC - QA were studied .

3 MLEC - QA Dataset 3.1 Data Collection We collect 155,429 multi - choice questions from the 2006 to 2020 NMLEC and practice exercises from the Internet .
Except for the categories that do not use Chinese in examinations , all categories are included in MLEC - QA : Clinic ( Cli ) , Stomatology ( Sto ) , Public Health ( PH ) , Traditional Chinese
8865Medicine ( TCM ) , and Chinese Western Medicine ( CWM ) .
After removing duplicated or incomplete questions ( e.g. , some options missing ) , there are 136,236 questions in MLEC - QA , and each question contains ﬁve candidate options with one correct / best option and four incorrect or partially correct options .
We describe in detail the JSON data structure of MLEC - QA in Appendix B. MLEC - QA contains 1,286 questions with extra materials that provide additional information to answer correctly .
As shown in Figure 1 , the extra materials are all in a graphical format with various types , such as ECG , table of a patient ’s condition record , formula , CT , line graph , explanatory drawing , etc .
We include these questions with extra materials in MLEC - QA to facilitate future BQA explorations on the crossover studies of CV and NLP , although we will not exploit them in this work due to the various speciﬁcs involved in extra materials .
( a ) ECG   ( b ) Table ( c ) Explanatory Drawing   ( d ) CT ( e ) Line Graph   ( f ) Formula Figure 1 : Examples of extra materials .
Basically , as shown in Table 2and
Table 4
, the questions in MLEC - QA are divided into ﬁve types including : •A1 : single statement question ; •B1 : similar to A1 , with a group of options shared in multiple questions;•A2 : questions accompanied by a clinical scenario ; •A3 : similar to A2 , with information shared among multiple independent questions ; •A4 : similar to A3 , with information shared among multiple questions , new information can be gradually added .
We further classify these questions into Knowledge Questions ( KQ ) and Case Questions ( CQ ) , where KQ ( A1+B1 ) focus on the deﬁnition and comprehension of biomedical knowledge , while CQ ( A2+A3 / A4 ) require analysis and practical application for real - world medical scenarios .
Both types of questions require multiple reasoning ability to answer .
SubsetKnowledge Questions Case Questions TotalA1 ( Extra ) B1 ( Extra ) A2 ( Extra ) A3 / A4 ( Extra ) Cli 16,996 ( 19 ) 5,327 ( 21 ) 6,823 ( 7 ) 4,495 ( 26 ) 33,641 Sto 14,796 ( 269 ) 5,084 ( 84 ) 3,528 ( 325 ) 3,041 ( 311 ) 26,449 PH 10,413 ( 14 ) 3,949 ( 2 ) 2,469 ( 25 ) 1,693 ( 55 ) 18,524 TCM 15,235 ( 10 ) 8,045 ( 14 ) 6,044 ( 48 ) 1,541 ( 9 ) 30,865 CWM 14,051 ( 9 ) 7,336 ( 22 ) 5,370 ( 16 ) 0 26,757 Total 71,491 29,741 24,234 10,770 136,236 Table 4 : Statistics of question types in MLEC - QA , where " Extra " indicates number of questions with extra materials .
Only A1 , A2 , and B1 are used in the examination of Chinese Western Medicine .
For the Train / Dev / Test split , randomly splitting may cause data imbalance because the number of the ﬁve question types are various from each other ( e.g. , A1 is far more than others ) .
To ensure that the subsets have the same distribution of the question types , we split the data based on the question types , with 80 % training , 10 % development , and 10 % test .
The overall statistics of the MLEC - QA dataset are summarized in Table 5 .
We can see that the length of the questions and the vocabulary size in Clinic are larger than the rest of the subsets , explaining that clinical medicine may involve more medical subjects than other specialties .

Vocabulary size is measured by Pkuseg ( Luo et al . , 2019 ) in words .
88663.2 Reasoning Types of the Questions Since the annual examination papers are designed by a team of healthcare experts who try to follow the similar reasoning types distribution .
To better understand our dataset , we manually inspected 10 sets of examination papers ( 2 sets for each subﬁeld ) , and summarize the most frequent reasoning types of the questions from MLEC - QA and previous works ( Lai et al . , 2017 ; Zhong et al . , 2020 ) .
The examples are shown in Table 6 .
Notably , the " Evidence " is well - organized by us to show how models need to handle these reasoning issues to achieve promising performance in MLEC - QA .
The deﬁnition of reasoning types of the questions are as follows : Lexical Matching This type of question is common and the simplest .
The retrieved documents are highly matched with the question , the correct answer exactly matches a span in the document .
As shown in the example , the model only needs to check which option is matched with .
Multi - Sentence Reading Unlike lexical matching , where questions and correct answers can be found within a single sentence , multi - sentence reading requires models reading multiple sentences to gather enough information to generate answers .
Concept Summary The correct options for this type of question do not appear directly in the documents .
It requires the model to understand and summarize the question relevant concepts after reading the documents .
As shown in the example , the model needs to understand and summarize the relevant mechanism of " Thermoregulation " , and infer that when an obstacle arises in thermoregulation , the body temperature will not be able to maintain a relatively constant level , that is , it will rise with the increase of ambient temperature .
Numerical Calculation
This type of question involves logical reasoning and arithmetic operations related to mathematics .
As shown in the example , the model ﬁrst needs to judge the approximate age of month according to the height of the infant , and then reverse calculate the age of months according to the height formula of infants 7~12 months old to obtain the age in months : ( 68 - 65 ) / 1.5 + 6 = 8 .
Multi - Hop Reasoning This type of question requires several steps of logical reasoning over mul - tiple documents to answer .
As shown in the example , the patient ’s hemoglobin ( HB ) value is low , indicating that the patient has anemia , and the supply of iron should be increased in their diet .
The model needs to compare the iron content of each option : the iron content of C , D and E is low and that of A , B is high , but B is not easily absorbed , so the best answer is A. Reasoning Type Example ( ∗represents the correct answer )
Lexical MatchingThe main hallmark of peritonitis is : A. Signiﬁcant abdominal distension B. Abdominal mobility dullness C. Bowel sounds were reduced or absent D. Severe abdominal cramping ∗E. Peritoneal irritation signs Evidence : The hallmark signs of peritonitis are peritoneal irritation signs , i.e. , tenderness , muscle tension , and rebound tenderness .
Multi - Sentence ReadingWhich is wrong in the following narrative relating to the appendix : A.
The appendiceal artery is the terminal artery B. Appendiceal tissues contain abundant lymphoid follicles C. Periumbilical pain at appendicitis onset visceral pain ∗D. Resection of the appendix in adults will impair the body ’s immune function
E. There are argyrophilic cells in the deep part of the appendiceal mucosa , which are associated with carcinoid tumorigenesis Evidence : ( 1 ) The appendiceal artery is a branch of the ileocolic artery and is a terminal artery without collaterals ; ( 2 ) The appendix is a lymphoid organ[ ...
]Therefore , resection of the adult appendix does not compromise the body ’s immune function ; ( 3 ) The nerves of the appendix are supplied by sympathetic ﬁbers[ ... ]belonging to visceral pain ; ( 4 ) Argyrophilic cells are found in the appendiceal mucosa and are the histological basis for the development of appendiceal carcinoids .
Concept SummaryThe main hallmark of thermoregulatory disorders in hyperthermic environments is : A. Developed syncope B. Developed shock C. Dry heat of skin ∗D. Increased body temperature E. Decreased body temperature Evidence : The purpose of thermoregulation is to maintain body temperature in the normal range .
In hyperthermic environments , the thermoregulatory center is dysfunctional and can not maintain the body ’s balance of heat production and heat dissipation , so the body temperature is increased by the inﬂuence of ambient temperature .
Numerical CalculationA normal infant , weighing 7.5 kg and measuring 68 cm in length .
Bregma 1.0 cm , head circumference 44 cm .
Teething 4 .
Can sit alone and can pick up pellets with a hallux and foreﬁnger .
The most likely age of the infant is : ∗A. 8 months B. 24 months C. 18 months D. 12 months E. 5 months Evidence : A normal infant measured 65 cm at 6 months and 75 cm at 1 year of age .
The infant ’s 7 to 12 month length is calculated as : length = 65 + ( months of age - 6 ) x 1.5 .
Multi - Hop Reasoning6 - month - old female infant , artiﬁcial feeding mainly , physical examination revealed a low hemoglobin ( HB ) value , the dietary supplement that should be mainly added is : ∗A. Liver paste B. Egg yolk paste C. Tomato paste D. Rice paste E. Apple puree Evidence : ( 1 ) Low HB value indicates anemia tendency .
Iron deﬁciency anemia is the most important and common type of anemia in China .
( 2 ) Iron supply should be increased in diet .
( 3 ) Liver paste is rich in iron .
( 4 ) The iron content of egg yolk paste is lower than that of liver paste , and it is not easy to be absorbed .
( 5 ) The iron content of tomato paste , rice paste and apple puree is lower than that of liver paste .
Table 6 : Examples of reasoning types of the questions in MLEC - QA .
The Chinese version is in Appendix E. 4 Methods Notation We represent MLEC - QA task as : ( D , Q , O , A ) , where Qirepresents the ith Question , Direpresents the collection of retrieved question relevant Documents , Oi= { OiA , OiB , OiC , OiD , OiE}are the candidate Options , Airepresents Answer , and we use A′ ito denote the Predicted Answer .
88674.1 Document Retriever Both examination counseling books and Wikipedia have been used as the source of supporting materials in previous research ( Zhong et al . , 2020 ; Jin et al . , 2020 ; Vilares and GómezRodríguez , 2019 ) .
However , because examination counseling books are designed to help examinees pass the examination , knowledge is highly simpliﬁed and summarized ; even the easily confused knowledge points are compared .
Using examination counseling books as information sources may make the retriever - reader more likely to exploit shallow text matching , and complex reasoning is seldom involved .
Therefore , to help better understand the improvement coming from future models , we adopt Chinese Wikipedia dumps as our information sources , which contain a wealth of information ( over 1 million articles ) of real - world facts .
Building upon the whole Chinese Wikipedia data , we use a distributed search and analytics engine , ElasticSearch , as the document store and document retriever , which supports very fast full - text searches .
The similarity scoring function used in Elasticsearch is the BM25 algorithm ( Robertson and Zaragoza , 2009 ) , which measures the relevance of documents to a given search query .
As deﬁned in Appendix C , the larger this BM25 score , the stronger the relevance between document and query .
Speciﬁcally , for each question Qiand each candidate option Oijwhere j∈ { A , B , C , D , E } , we deﬁne QiOij = Qi+Oijas a search query to Elasticsearch and is repeated for all options .
The document with the highest BM25 score returned by each query is selected as supporting materials for the next stage machine reading comprehension task .
4.2 Control Methods In general , each option should have the same correct rate for multi - choice questions , but in fact , the order in which the correct options appear is not completely random , and the more the number of options , the lower the degree of randomization ( Poundstone , 2014 ) .
Given the complex nature of multi - choice tasks , we employ three control methods to ensure a fair comparison among various open - domain QA models .
Random A′=Random ( O ) .
For each question , an option is randomly chosen as the answerfrom ﬁve candidate options .
We perform this experiment ﬁve times and average the results as the baseline of the Random method .
Constant A′=Constant j(O ) , where j∈ { A , B , C , D , E } .
For each question , the jthoption is always chosen as the answer to obtain the accuracy distribution of ﬁve candidate options .
Mixed A′=Mixed ( O ) .
Incorporating the previous experiences of NMLEC and multi - choice task work ( Vilares and Gómez - Rodríguez , 2019 ) , the Mixed method simulates how humans solving uncertain questions , and consists of the following three strategies : ( 1 ) the correct rate of choosing " All of the options above is correct / incorrect " is much higher than the other options .
( 2 ) Supposing the length of options is roughly equal , only one option is obviously longer with more detailed and speciﬁc descriptions , or is obviously shorter than the other options , then choose this option .
( 3 ) The correct option tends to appear in the middle of candidate options .
The three strategies are applied in turn .
If any strategy matches , then the option that matches the strategy is chosen as the answer .
4.3 Fine - Tuning Pre - Trained Language Models We apply an uniﬁed framework UER - py ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) to ﬁne - tuning pre - trained language models on the machine reading comprehension task as our reader .
We consider the following ﬁve pre - trained language models : Chinese BERT - Base ( denoted as BERT - Base ) and Multilingual Uncased BERT - Base ( denoted as BERT - BaseMultilingual ) ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) , Chinese BERTBase with whole word masking and pre - trained over larger corpora ( denoted as BERT - wwm - ext ) ( Cui et al . , 2019 ) , and the robustly optimized BERTs : Chinese RoBERTa - wwm - ext and Chinese RoBERTa - wwm - ext - large ( Cui et al . , 2019 ) .
Speciﬁcally , given the ithquestion Qi , retrieved question relevant documents Di , and a candidate option Oij , where j∈ { A , B , C , D , E } .
The input sequence for the framework is constructed by concatenating [ CLS ] , tokens in Di , [ SEP ] , tokens in Qi , [ SEP ] , tokens in an option Oij , and [ SEP ] , where [ CLS ] is the classiﬁer token , and [ SEP ] is the sentence separator in pre - trained language models .
We pass each of the ﬁve options in turn , and the model outputs the hidden state representation Sij∈R1×Hof the input sequence ,
8868then performs the classiﬁcation and output an unnormalized log probability Pij∈Rof each optionOijbeing correct by Pij = SijWT , where W∈R1×His the weight matrix .
Finally , we pass the unnormalized log probabilities of each option through a softmax layer and obtain the option with the highest probability as the predicted answer A′ i. 5 Experiments 5.1 Experimental Settings We conduct detailed experiments and analyses to investigate the performance of control methods and open - domain QA methods on MLEC - QA .
As shown in Figure 2 , we implement a two - stage retriever - reader framework : ( 1 ) a retriever ﬁrst retrieves question relevant documents from Chinese Wikipedia using ElasticSearch , ( 2 ) and then a reader employs machine reading comprehension models to generate answers in given documents retrieved by the retriever .
For the reader , all machine reading comprehension models are trained with 12 epochs , an initial learning rate of 2e-6 , a maximum sequence length of 512 , a batch size of 5 .
The parameters are selected based on the best performance on the development set , and we keep the default values for the other hyper - parameters ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) .
We use accuracy as the metric to evaluate different methods , and provide baseline results , as well as human pass mark ( 60 % ) instead of human performance due to the wide variations exist in human performance , from almost full marks to can not even pass the exam .

5.2 Retrieval Performance The main drawbacks of the Chinese Wikipedia database in biomedicine are that it is not comprehensive and thorough , that is , it may not provide complete coverage of all subjects .
To evaluate whether retrieved documents can cover enough evidence to answer questions , we sampled 5%(681 ) questions from the development sets of ﬁve categories using stratiﬁed random sampling , and manually annotate each question by ﬁve medical experts with 3 labels : ( 1 ) Exactly Match ( EM ): the retrieved documents exactly match the question .
( 2 ) Partial Match ( PM ): the retrieved documents partially match the question , can be confused with the correct options or are incomplete .
( 3 ) Mismatch ( MM ): the retrieved documents do not match the question at all .
Table 7lists the performance of the retrieval strategy as well as the results of the annotation for KQ and CQ questions on ﬁve subsets .
Subset EM ( KQ / CQ ) PM ( KQ / CQ ) MM ( KQ / CQ ) Cli 15.63 ( 18.75 / 12.5 ) 75 ( 68.75 / 81.25 ) 9.38 ( 12.5 / 6.25 )
Sto 20.83 ( 16.67 / 25 ) 54.17 ( 50 / 58.33 ) 25 ( 33.33 / 16.67 ) PH 6.25 ( 0 / 12.5 ) 43.75 ( 50 / 37.5 ) 50 ( 50 / 50 ) TCM 10.71 ( 14.29 / 7.14 ) 50 ( 42.86 / 57.14 ) 39.29 ( 42.86 / 35.71 ) CWM 20.83 ( 8.33 / 33.33 ) 54.17 ( 58.33 / 50 ) 25 ( 33.33 / 16.67 ) Table 7 : Matching rate ( % ) of retrieved documents that exactly match , partial match or mismatch with the questions in the MLEC - QA dataset .
From the table , we make the following observations .
First , most retrieved documents indicate PM with the questions , while the matching rates of EM and MM achieve maximums of 20.83 % ( CWM ) and 50 % ( PH ) , respectively .
Second , the matching rate of CQ is higher than KQ in most subsets as CQ are usually related to simpler concepts , and use more words to describe questions , which leads to easier retrieval .
By contrast , KQ usually involve more complex concepts that may not be included in the Chinese Wikipedia database .
Therefore , the mismatching rate of KQ is signiﬁcantly higher than that of CQ .
Third , among different subsets , the performance in the subset Cli achieves the best as clinical medicine is more " general " to retrieve compare with other specialties .
Whereas the performance in the subset PH achieves the worst as the Public Health is usually related to " confusing concepts " , which leads to poor retrieval performance .
5.3 Baseline Results Tables 8and
Figure 3show the performance of baselines as well as the performance on KQ and CQ questions .
As we can see , among control methods , the correct option has a slight tendency to appear in the middle ( C and D ) of candidate options , but the margins are small .
The performance of the Mixed method is slightly better than a random guess , which indicates that the ﬂexible use of

guessing skills may add wings to the tiger as humans can exclude some certain wrong options , but if the cart before the horse is reversed , it is impossible to pass the exam only through opportunistic guessing .
RoBERTa - wwm - ext - large and BERTwwm - ext perform better than other models on ﬁve subsets .
However , even the best - performing model can only achieve accuracies between 40 % to 55 % on ﬁve subsets , so there is still a gap to pass the exams .
Figure 3 : Performance in accuracy ( % ) on KQ ( solid lines ) and CQ ( dashed lines ) questions .
Comparing the performance between KQ and CQ questions , most models achieve better performance on CQ , which is positively correlated with CQ ’s better retrieval performance .
Among different subsets , the subset TCM is the easiest ( 54.95 % ) one to answer across the board , while the subset PH is the hardest ( 40.04 % ) , which does not totally correspond to their retrieval performance asshown in Table 7 .
The possible reason is that the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in traditional Chinese medicine are characterized by " Homotherapy for Heteropathy " , that is , treating different diseases with the same method , which may result in some patterns or mechanisms that can be used by the models to reach such results .
5.4 Comparative Analysis Given that we use the Chinese Wikipedia database as our information sources and apply a two - stage retriever - reader framework , the reason for such poor baseline performance could come from both our information sources and the retriever - reader framework .
Information Sources Both books and Wikipedia have been used as the information sources in previous research .
One of our subsets , Clinic , has been studied by MEDQA ( Jin et al . , 2020 ) as a subset ( MCMLE ) for cross - lingual research .
MEDQA uses 33 medical textbooks as their information sources and the evaluation result shows that their collected text materials can provide enough information to answer all the questions in MCMLE .
We compare the best model ( RoBERTa - wwm - ext - large ) performance on both datasets as shown in Table 9 .
Notably , questions in MCMLE have four candidate options due to one of the wrong options being deleted .
Therefore , the random accuracy on MCMLE is higher than ours .
From the results we can see that even with 100 % covered materials , the best model can only
8870DatasetAccuracy ( % ) Dev Test MEDQA ( MCMLE ) 69.30 70.10 MLEC - QA ( Clinic ) 53.25 53.22 Table 9 : Comparison of best model ( RoBERTa - wwmext - large ) performance on MEDQA and our MLECQA dataset .
achieve 16.88 % higher accuracy on the test set than ours , which indicates that using Wikipedia as information sources is not that terrible compared with medical books , and the main reason for baseline performance may come from machine reading comprehension models that lack sophisticated reasoning ability .
Retriever - Reader We also perform an experiment that sampled 5 % ( 92 ) questions from the development set of Public Health , and manually annotate each question by a medical expert to determine whether that can exactly or partially match with the top K retrieved documents , as shown in Table 10 .
Notably , the actual number of retrieved documents is 5×Kas we deﬁne QiOij = Qi+Oij as a search query and is repeated for all options .
From the results , we can see that more documents even bring more noise instead , as the best match documents have already been fetched in the top 1 documents .
It indicates that the poor performance of machine reading comprehension models is coming from the insufﬁciency of reasoning ability rather than the number of retrieved documents .
Top K 1 2 3 4 5 Match 52.08 42.19 36.25 32.29 29.46 Table 10 : Matching rate ( % ) of Top K retrieved documents that exactly or partial match with the questions in the Public Health subset .
6 Conclusion We present the largest - scale Chinese multi - choice BQA dataset , MLEC - QA , which contains ﬁve biomedical subﬁelds with extra materials ( images or tables ) annotated by human experts : Clinic , Stomatology , Public Health , Traditional Chinese Medicine , and Chinese Western Medicine .
Such questions correspond to examinations ( NMLEC ) to access the qualiﬁcations of medical practitioners in the Chinese healthcare system , and requirespecialized domain knowledge and multiple reasoning abilities to be answered .
We implement eight representative control methods and opendomain QA methods by a two - stage retrieverreader framework as baselines .
The experimental results demonstrate that even the current best approaches can not achieve good performance on MLEC - QA .
We hope MLEC - QA can beneﬁt researchers on improving the open - domain QA models , and also make advances for BQA systems .

= n∑ i=1IDF ( qi)·f(qi , D)·(k1 + 1 ) f(qi , D ) + k1 · ( 1−b+b·|D| avgdl),(1 ) where qiis the ithquery term of a query Q , f(qi , D)isqi ’s term frequency in the document D,|D|is the length of the document Din words , andavgdl is the average document length in the text collection from which documents are drawn .
bdetermines the effects of the length of the document on the average length .
k1is a variable which helps determine term frequency saturation characteristics .
By default , b , k1has a value of 0.75 , 1.2 in Elasticsearch , respectively .
IDF ( qi)is the Inverse Document Frequency ( IDF ) weight of the query term qi .
It is usually computed as : IDF ( qi ) = ln ( N−n(qi )
+ 0 .5 n(qi ) + 0
.5 + 1 ) , ( 2)where Nis the total number of documents in the collection , and n(qi)is the number of documents containing qi .
