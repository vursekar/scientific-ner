The dominant methods make use of pre - trained language models by learning effective aspect category - speciﬁc representations , and adding speciﬁc output layers to its pre - trained representation .
We consider a more direct way of making use of pre - trained language models , by casting the ACSA tasks into natural language generation tasks , using natural language sentences to represent the output .
Our method allows more direct use of pre - trained knowledge in seq2seq language models by directly following the task setting during pre - training .
Experiments on several benchmarks show that our method gives the best reported results , having large advantages in few - shot and zero - shot settings .
1 Introduction Aspect - based sentiment analysis ( ABSA ) is a ﬁnegrained sentiment analysis task that includes a number of subtasks , two of which are aspect category sentiment analysis ( ACSA ) and aspect category detection ( ACD ) .
Figure 1 shows an example , where the input is “ The restaurant was expensive , but the menu was great ” .
ACD detects the aspect categories , such as price andfood , and ACSA predicts the sentiment polarities toward each aspect category .
In this work , we focus on these two tasks as well as the joint task that combines both .
Previous studies have investigated various methods that treat ACSA and ACD as classiﬁcation tasks , learning aspect - speciﬁc sentence representations ( Wang et al . , 2016 ; Ruder et al . , 2016 ) .
Recently , pre - trained language models ( PLM ) have shown their effectiveness to this end ( Jiang et al . , 2019 ) .
The main idea is to make use of pre - trained models such as BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019a ) for representing an aspect - speciﬁc form of the input ( e.g. , by concatenating the aspect category to the end of The restaurant was expensive , but the menu was great < price , food > < price : negative >    <
food : positive > ACSAACDFigure 1 : Example of aspect category detection ( ACD ) and aspect category sentiment analysis ( ACSA ) .
the input sentence ( Figure 3(a ) ) ) , which provides useful semantic features for ACSA and ACD classiﬁers .
Such methods have given highly competitive results ( Sun et al . , 2019 ; Li et
al . , 2020b ) .
The above classiﬁcation models beneﬁt from contextualized representations , which contain knowledge learned by pre - training over large data ( Lin et al . , 2019 ) .
However , their use of pre - trained knowledge can be viewed as indirect due to at least two reasons .
First , the classiﬁcation task is performed by using a neural network on top of pretrained representation , with separate network parameters .
Second , the integration of aspect category makes the aspect - speciﬁc input representation not exactly a natural language sentence , which differs from the pre - training setting .
Intuitively , more pre - trained knowledge could be leveraged by connecting pre - training and ACSA at the task level , rather than only at the representation level .
We investigate the above potentials by casting the sentiment classiﬁcation tasks into language modelling tasks .
In particular , as shown in Figure 2 , both ACSA and ACD are transformed into sequence - to - sequence ( seq2seq ) tasks , where the encoder takes the input sentence and the decoder generates a natural language sentence .
For ACD , the output follows a template stating whether the speciﬁc aspect is discussed ( e.g. , “ The hcategory _ typeicategory is discussed ” ) ; for ACSA , the sentiment polarity of a speciﬁc aspect is stated ( e.g. , “ The sentiment polarity of hgiven _ categoryiishpolarity _ typei ” ) .
The setting corresponds closely to the denoising auto-

encoder training scheme of BART ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ) , which we use as the pre - trained model .
Compared with classiﬁcation - based methods , our method does not include more network parameters , and thus can potentially generalize better to new domains ( Brown et al . , 2020 ;
Gao et al . , 2020 ) .
Given a new domain with completely unseen aspect categories and sentiment labels , our method can be applied without changing output layer structure .
In addition to classiﬁcation - based methods , we take masked language models ( MLM ) as a baseline also , for which a natural counterpart of our method is a mask - reﬁlling task .
As shown in Figure 3(b ) , different from our method , the output template is concatenated to the input , with the keyword being masked for prediction .
This MLM task corresponds closely to BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019a ) pre - training .
In comparison to this MLM method , a generation method can better learn the correlation between the input and output template as two related sequences , which has been demonstrated by the strong performance of BART for abstractive text summarization ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ) .
Experimental results on three standard benchmarks datasets show that both generation and MLM methods outperform classiﬁcation methods using the same pre - trained language models .
Finally , generation methods give stronger performances than MLM methods , outperforming the previous stateof - the - art methods by a large margin .
In addition , using the generation method , we show that jointly performing ACSA and ACD leads to better results than the traditional pipeline .
To our knowledge , we are the ﬁrst to employ a generative pre - trained language model to address an ACSA / ACD problem .
We release our code at https://github . com / lgw863 / ACSA - generation .2

Generation Methods
There has been work casting NLP problems as sequence generation tasks ( Vinyals et al . , 2015 ; Ma et al . , 2017 ; Stanovsky and Dagan , 2018 ;
Raffel et al . , 2020 ) , where the output is a sequence of tokens rather than a natural language sentence .
Daza and Frank ( 2018 ) treat semantic role labelling as a sequence - to - sequence process .
Li et
al .
( 2019 ) solve the entity - relation extraction task as a multi - turn question answering generation method .
Our work is similar in casting an NLP task as a generation task .
Different from the above methods , our goal is to make the most of pre - trained knowledge in BART for ACSA .
3 Methods Formally for ACD , the input is a sentence X= fx1 ; : : : ; x ng = x1 : n , where xidenotes the i - th word .
For ACSA , a set of pre - identiﬁed aspect categories are also given .
We introduce relevant pre - trained language models in 3.1 , classiﬁcation methods in Section 3.2 , MLM methods in Section 3.3 , and our generation method in Section 3.4.3.1 Pre - trained language Models We take BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019a ) and BART ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ) as the pre - trained language models .
Both are built on the Transformer ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) architecture .
BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019a ) is an encoder stack of Transformer for masked text ﬁlling , where a model uses the context words to predict masked words .
BART ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ) is a denoising auto - encoder seq2seq model pre - training for natural language generation .
Its training applies document corruption such as randomly deleting tokens from the input and corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function .
BART is trained to reconstruct the original text .
3.2 The Classiﬁcation Method We use a multi - layer perceptrons network as the classiﬁer model , which takes a representation vector as input .
Both BERT and BART are considered as the encoders .
BERT Classiﬁcation BERT adopts “ [ CLS ] input sentence
[ SEP ] given_category
[ SEP ] ” as input .
The ﬁnal hidden state corresponding to “ [ CLS ] ” is used as the representation for classiﬁcation .
BART Classiﬁcation BART adopts “ hSiinput sentenceh = Sigiven_categoryh = Si ” as input and predicts the sentiment polarity of the sentence towards the given category .
The same input is fed into the encoder and decoder ( see Figure 3(a ) ) .
Formally , suppose that the query category is a , x0 = hSi , xn+1 = h = Si , xn+2 = a , xn+3 = h = Si , then the input to BART is x0 : n+3= hSix1 ; : : : ; x nh = Siah = Si .
The output hidden vec-
4409tors obtained by the BART encoder ( ENCODER ) and BART decoder ( D ECODER ) are : henc = ENCODER ( x0 : n+3 ) h0 : : : hn+3
= DECODER ( henc;x0 : n+3 )
The output vector hn+3is then taken as the representation vector for classiﬁcation .
3.3
The MLM Method Masked language models ( MLM ) ( Devlin et al . , 2019a ) complete a given prompt by ﬁlling missing tokens .
We refer to the template including a given category and MASK token together as a prompt .
For sentiment analysis tasks , BERT MLM adopts the input sentence and the prompt as the model input and predicts the sentiment polarity label word towards the given category .
For BART MLM , the same input is fed into the encoder and decoder , and the highest decoder prediction from label words of the MASK token is the predicted polarity label(see Figure 3(b ) ) .
We use the same template in the MLM method and generation method , following the template creation method in section 3.4.1 .
3.4 The Generation Method We take both ACSA and ACD as language model ranking problems under a seq2seq framework ( see Figure 3(c ) ) .
The target sequence Tai;pk(Tai )
= ft1 ; : : : ; t mgis a template ﬁlled by the given category aiand the polarity type pk .
We ﬁrst introduce how to create templates in Section 3.4.1 , and then show the inference and training details in Section 3.4.2 and Section 3.4.3 , respectively .
3.4.1 Template Creation For ACSA , we manually create templates containing one slot for the given _ category and another slot for the polarity _ type label .
We set a category word set A = fa1 ; : : : ; ajCjg , jCjis the category type size ( e.g. , ai=“price ” ) and polarity type word set P = fp1 ; : : : ; pjLjg , jLjis the polarity type size ( e.g. , pk=“positive ” ) , and use words to deﬁne templates Tai;pk(e.g .
“ The sentiment polarity of price is positive ” ) .
The template T is “ The sentiment polarity of haiiishpki ” .
For a given category ai , we can obtain a list of templates Tai=
[ Tai;p1 ; : : : ; Tai;pjLj ] .
For ACD , we use aito create a sentiment templateT+ aifor an existing aspect category , and a none - category template T  ai .
T+is “ Thehaiicategory is discussed " andT is “ Thehaiicategory is not discussed " .3.4.2
Inference For ACSA , we ﬁrst enumerate all possible polarities for the given category of the sentence Xand ﬁll them in the prepared templates , and then use the ﬁne - tuned pre - trained generative language model to assign a score for each template Tai;pk = ft1 ; : : : ; t mg , formulated as : f(Tai;pk ) = mX c=1logP(tcjt1 : c 1;X ) ( 1 ) We calculate a score f(Tai;pk)for each possible polarity by employing the pre - trained generative language model ( i.e. , BART ) to score the templates , and then choose the polarity of category aiwith the largest score .
For ACD , we ﬁrst create templates T+ aiandT  ai for all possible categories of the sentence X , and then use the ﬁne - tuned pre - trained generative language model to assign a score for each template Tai = ft1 ; : : : ; t mg , in a similar way as Equation 1 .
Also , we decide whether the aicategory is discussed or not in the input sentence according to the higher score between T+ aiandT  ai .
3.4.3 Training For ACSA , suppose that the polarity type of aiispk .
We ﬁll the given category aiand the polarity type pkinto template Tto create a gold target output Tai;pk .
Similarly for ACD , if the category of aiis discussed , the gold target T+ aiis obtained by ﬁlling aiintoT+ , and otherwise is T  ai .
For ACSA , we use all gold polarities in the training set to construct ( X;T)pairs .
For ACD , we use all gold categories in the training set to construct ( X;T+)pairs , and additionally create negative samples ( X;T )by sampling all none existing categories in the input .
Finally , we obtain f(X;T)g = f(X;T+)[(X;T )g Given a sequence pair ( X;T ) , we feed the input X = x1 : nto the BART encoder , obtaining hidden representations of the sentence : henc = ENCODER ( x1 : n ) ( 2 ) At the cth step of the decoder , hencand previous output tokens t1 : c 1are then as inputs , yielding a representation using attention ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 )
hdec c = DECODER ( henc ; t1 : c 1 ) ( 3 ) The conditional probability of the word tcis deﬁned as : P(tcjt1 : c 1;X ) =
SOFTMAX ( hdec cWlm+blm);(4 ) where Wlm2RdhjVjandblm2RjVj , jVjrepresents the vocab size of pre - trained BART .
The
4410cross - entropy between the decoder ’s output and the original template is used as the loss function : L= mX c=1logP(tcjt1;c 1;X ) ( 5 ) 4 Experiments We choose the SemEval-2014 restaurant review ( Rest14 ) ( Pontiki et al . , 2014a ) , a variant of Rest14 ( Rest14 - hard ) ( Xue and Li , 2018 ) and the multiaspect multi - sentiment ( MAMS ) ( Jiang et al . , 2019 ) datasets for sentence - level sentiment , the TripAdvisor ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) and BeerAdvocate ( McAuley et al . , 2012 ; Lei et al . , 2016 ) datasets for document - level sentiment .
Standard splits of training / development / testing sets are adopted following previous work Tay et al .
( 2018 ) , the details of which are shown in Appendix A.
We use the pre - trained BERT - base1and BARTbase2models for task ﬁne - tuning .
We select the ﬁne - tuning learning rate from { 4e-5 , 2e-5 , and 1e5 } and batch size from { 8 , 16 , 24 } for different models .
The dropout probability is 0.1 .
The best model conﬁguration is selected according to the highest performance on the development set .
The details of settings are shown in Appendix A. 4.1 Baseline Methods We compare our generation method with classiﬁcation and MLM baselines ( Figure 3 ) using the same encoder .
In particular , BART generation ( i.e. , Figure 3(c ) ) is compared with BART classiﬁcation ( Figure 3(a ) ) and BART MLM ( Figure 3(b ) ) , as well as BERT classiﬁcation andBERT MLM .
In addition , our method is also compared with other models in the literature as follows .
For sentence - level ACSA , we also compare our method with the following state - of - the - art methods in the literature .
( 1 ) non - BERT models : GCAE ( Xue and Li , 2018 ) ,

4.2 Development Experiments Different templates can be used for expressing the same meaning .
For instance , “ The sentiment polarity of hgiven _ categoryiis positive ” can also be expressed by “ The sentiment is positive forhgiven _ categoryi ” .
For ACSA , we investigate the impact of manual templates using the MAMS development set .
Table 1 shows the impact of different choice of templates .
For instance , “ Thehgiven _ categoryi category has ahpolarity _ typeilabel ” and “ The sentiment polarity of hgiven _ categoryiis hpolarity _ typei ” give 82.31 % and 83.78 % accuracy , respectively , indicating that the template has inﬂuence on the ﬁnal performance .
This is consistent with ﬁnds of Gao et al .
( 2020 ) for the fewshot task .
Based on the development results , we use the top performing template “ The sentiment polarity ofhgiven _ categoryiishpolarity _ typei ” in our ACSA experiments .
For ACD , we investigate the impact of templates using the Rest14 development set .
Table 2 shows the performance impact of different templates .
We use the top performing template “ The hcategory _ typeicategory is discussed ” as templateT+and “ Thehcategory _ typeicategory is not discussed ” as template T in our ACD experiments .

4.3 ACSA Experiments The results of sentence - level ACSA are shown in Table 3 .
We can see that , ﬁrst , the performance of BERT MLM andBART MLM is better than BERT classiﬁcation andBART classiﬁcation , respectively .
In particular , BERT MLM gives a strong baseline , outperforming all non - BERT and BERT classiﬁcation baselines .
This shows that making use of pre - training at the tasklevel can achieve better results than that at the representation level .
Also , the BART MLM andclassiﬁcation models perform better than the corresponding BERT models .
Second , BART generation outperforms all baselines on all three datasets , which indicates that our model can better detect multiple sentiment polarities in one sentence toward different aspect categories .
Third , BART generation performs signiﬁcantly better than BART MLM , giving absolutely 3.89 % stronger accuracy on MAMS , demonstrating the effectiveness of the generation method .
This shows the strength of BART pre - training for generating semantically related content , which was also reﬂected by the strong performance of BART on abstractive sum - Model P R F1 XRCE 83.23 81.37 82.29 NRC - Canada 91.04 86.24 88.58 BERT classiﬁcation 92.78 89.07 90.89 BERT - pair - NLI - B 93.57 90.83 92.18

In contrast , the MLM method concatenates the input and output into one sequence , and thus fails to model their correlation in encoder - decoder pre - trainng .
The performances of our model on documentlevel ACSA are shown in Table 4 .
Compared with LSTM , HAN and MR , BERT classiﬁcationandBART classiﬁcation outperform all baselines , which shows the effectiveness of pre - training .
BERT MLM andBART MLM surpass BERT classiﬁcation andBART classiﬁcation , respectively .
Our BART generation model achieves improvements of 1.15 % and 0.70 % over BART MLM on TripAdvisor and BeerAdvocate , respectively , demonstrating that the generation method can more effectively make use of BART for ACSA .
4.4 ACD Experiments Results on the Rest14 ACD subtask are presented in Table 5 .
Following Pontiki et al .
( 2014b ) , we use Micro - F1 for evaluating .
Again BART generation achieves better results than BART classiﬁcation and BART MLM .

on precision and F-1 score .
In particular , a more than 95 % precision score is achieved , which shows that our model can effectively exclude the aspect categories not mentioned in the input .
We also investigate the performance on the MAMS dataset , which consists of at least two unique aspect categories with different sentiment polarities in each input sentence .
Table 7 shows thatBART generation outperforms all baselines , indicating better ability of our model to detect multiple aspect categories in one sentence .
4.5 A Joint Model
The generation method allows us to build a straightforward joint model by extending the ﬁrst template in Table 1 , using “ The sentiment polarity of < given_category > is none ” as a template for nonexisting aspect categories .
The results on Rest-14 and MAMS are presented in Table 6 .
We ﬁnd that joint BART generation achieves better results on this task with improvements over pipeline BART generation .
Joint BART generation outperforms all baselines on precision , recall and F-1 score , which shows the advantage of joint learning .

4.6 Few - Shot and Zero - Shot Learning We evaluate the model performance on ACSA where only a small amount of labelled data is available for training , simulating the low - resource data scenarios by randomly sampling training instances from a large training set .
In particular , we use different numbers of instances for training , randomly sampling a ﬁxed number of instances per category type ( 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 instances per category type for Rest14 and MAMS ) .
The results are shown in Figure 4 , where the methods of BERT classiﬁcation , BART classiﬁcation andBART MLM are also compared .
It can be seen that on all the datasets , our model outperforms BERT classiﬁcation , BART classiﬁcationandBART MLM , especially when the number of training instances is small .
For example , when there are only 10 training instances , our model gives accuracy scores of 82.01 % on Rest14 , as compared to 38.57 % by BERT classiﬁcation and 50.16 % by BART classiﬁcation .
When the number of instances grows as large as 500 , our model gives 2.24 % and 2.65 % better accuracies than BART MLM on Rest14 and MAMS , respectively .

possible reason is that our method makes more use of direct sentiment knowledge in the pre - trained language model by directly adopting the original structure of BART mentioned earlier .
In contrast , classiﬁcation methods can not achieve this due to transferring the sentiment bias indirectly .
The results of our zero - shot learning experiments are in Table 8 .
In all cases , our method outperforms all the baselines .
In particular , the model trained on MAMS has a better performance on Rest14 than the reverse zero - shot setting , which proves that the MAMS dataset has a higher challenge .
5 Analysis 5.1 Inﬂuence of Category Frequency Aspect categories can be implicit and do not necessarily occur as terms in the given sentence .
To explore the correlation between ACSA accuracy and the occurrence frequency of a given category , we split the eight categories in the MAMS test set into four subsets based on the occurrence frequency .
The category ( i.e. , miscellaneous ) that never occurs in the given sentence is put into the zero frequency subset , the 15 % least frequent ( i.e. , ambience , staff ) are put into low frequency subset , the 30 % most frequent ( i.e. , menu , service ) are put into high frequency subset , and the remaining ( i.e. , price , food , place ) are put into mid frequency subset .
Figure 5 shows the accuracy of BART classiﬁcation and our model against the frequency .
As the category occurrence frequency decreases , the relative gap of accuracy between the two models increases .
In the zero frequency , our method gives absolutely 8.03 % stronger accuracy than BART classiﬁcation .
This demonstrates that our method is more robust in summarizing the sentiment polarity of abstract or rare categories .
Even if there are no explicit category terms in the sentence , the generation method can give the implicit category opinion of the whole sentence according to the context .
Service was fine and the food deliver ed in r easonable time given the cr owd , but for the price I was disappointed .
< miscellaneous : neutral >    <
incorrect output : negative >
The kids r eally enjoyed their food and the value on the kids menu is good .
< menu : neutral >    <
incorrect output : positive >
The decor could be a bit better , and if ther e was a small bar the overall atmospher e would be a bit mor e inviting .
< place :
negative >    <
incorrect output : neutral > ( a ) ( b ) ( c)Figure 6 : Examples of BART classiﬁcation .
( a ) is an instance with category do not occur as term in sentence .
( b ) represents that our method is not affected by the surrounding interference information .
( c ) needs conditional reasoning for analysis .
Our method can obtain correct sentiment polarity .
5.2 Case Study Figure 6 shows typical examples from the test set which can not be inferred by the BART classiﬁcation model .
In sentence ( a ) , the given category miscellaneous does not occur as a term in the given sentence .
Our method can synthesize different sentiment polarities with different aspects to obtain correct polarity .
In sentence ( b ) , “ the value on the kids menu is good ” , good modiﬁes the value , rather than the given category menu .
Our method gives the correct polarity , not being affected by the surrounding other aspect sentiments .
The last instance ( c ) has conditional reasoning which is difﬁcult for BART classiﬁcation .
In contrast , BART generationgives the correct label by correctly recognizing the negativity in “ if there was ... would be a bit more inviting ” .
This is likely because our method makes use of pre - trained knowledge to infer the inter - sentential correlations between the input and the output sequences , which the BART classiﬁcationmodel failed to achieve due to the indirect use of BART in the additional classiﬁcation network .
6 Conclusion We investigated a generation method for aspect category detection ( ACD ) and aspect category sentiment analysis ( ACSA ) , which can make better use of BART ’s advantages in making semantic level summaries to the input by not introducing additional model parameters .
Experiments show that our proposed method obtains superior performance over the baseline models for both sentence - level and document - level aspect sentiment analysis .
In contrast to the traditional sentiment classiﬁcation methods , our method is also more powerful on zero - shot and few - shot tasks .

The rating scale of TripAdvisor dataset is 1 - 5 .
The rating scale of BeerAdvocate dataset is 1 - 10 .
Rest14 - hard Following Xue and Li ( 2018 ) , we construct Rest14 - hard , where the training set and development set are the same as Rest14 ’s , while test set is constructed from the test set of Rest14 .
The test set of Rest14 - hard only includes sentences containing at least two aspect categories with different sentiment polarities .
MAMS Jiang et
al .
( 2019 )
Since the test set of Rest14 - hard is small , we also adopt the MultiAspect Multi - Sentiment dataset for Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis ( denoted by MAMS ) .
All sentences in MAMS contain multiple aspect categories with different sentiment polarities .
A.2 Document - Level Datasets TripAdvisor ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) and BeerAdvocate ( McAuley et al . , 2012 ; Lei et al . , 2016 ) contain seven aspects ( value , room , location , cleanliness , check in / front desk , service , and business service ) and four aspects ( feel , look , smell , and taste ) respectively .
We randomly split them into training , development , and testing sets with 80/10/10 % .
Statistics of these three sentence - level datasets are given in Table 9 and two document - level datasets are described in Table 10 .
B Settings Each method is trained for 30 epochs , during which the model with the best performance on the validation set is saved .
We also apply early stopping in training , which means that the training will stop if the performance on validation set does not improve in 5 epochs .
