Abstract M¯aori loanwords are widely used in New Zealand English for various social functions by New Zealanders within and outside of the M¯aori community .
Motivated by the lack of linguistic resources for studying how M ¯aori loanwords are used in social media , we present a new corpus of New Zealand English tweets .
We collected tweets containing selected M ¯aori words that are likely to be known by New Zealanders who do not speak M ¯aori .
Since over 30 % of these words turned out to be irrelevant ( e.g. , mana is a popular gaming term , Moana is a character from a Disney movie ) , we manually annotated a sample of our tweets into relevant and irrelevant categories .
This data was used to train machine learning models to automatically ﬁlter out irrelevant tweets .
1 Introduction One of the most salient features of New Zealand English ( NZE ) is the widespread use of M ¯aori words ( loanwords ) , such as aroha ( love ) , kai ( food ) and Aotearoa ( New Zealand ) .
See ex .
( 1 ) speciﬁcally from Twitter ( note the informal , conversational style and the M ¯aori loanwords emphasised in bold ) .

Was told by the kaum ¯atua I did it with mana and integrity .
The use of M ¯aori words has been studied intensively over the past thirty years , offering a comprehensive insight into the evolution of one of the youngest dialects of English – New Zealand English ( Calude et
al . , 2017 ; Daly , 2007 , 2016 ; Davies and Maclagan , 2006 ; De Bres , 2006 ; Degani and Onysko , 2010 ; Kennedy and Yamazaki , 1999 ; Macalister , 2009 , 2006a ; Onysko and Calude , 2013 )
.
One aspect which is missing inthis body of work is the online discourse presence of the loanwords - almost all studies come from ( collaborative ) written language ( highly edited , revised and scrutinised newspaper language , Davies and Maclagan 2006 ; Macalister 2009 , 2006a , b ; Onysko and Calude 2013 , and picture - books , Daly 2007 , 2016 ) , or from spoken language collected in the late 1990s ( Kennedy and Yamazaki , 1999 ) .
In this paper , we build a corpus of New Zealand English tweets containing M ¯aori loanwords .
Building such a corpus has its challenges ( as discussed in Section 3.1 ) .
Before we discuss these , it is important to highlight the uniqueness of the language contact situation between M ¯aori and ( NZ ) English .
The language contact situation in New Zealand provides a unique case - study for loanwords because of a number of factors .
We list three particularly relevant here .
First , the direction of lexical transfer is highly unusual , namely , from an endangered indigenous language ( M ¯aori ) into a dominant lingua franca ( English ) .
The large - scale lexical transfer of this type has virtually never been documented elsewhere , to the best of our knowledge ( see summary of current language contact situations in Stammers and Deuchar 2012 , particularly Table 1 , p. 634 ) .
Secondly , because M ¯aori loanwords are “ New Zealand ’s and New Zealand ’s alone ” ( Deverson , 1991 , p. 18 - 19 ) , and above speakers ’ consciousness , their ardent study over the years provides a fruitful comparison of the use of loanwords across genres , contexts and time .
Finally , the aforementioned body of previous research on the topic is rich and detailed , and still rapidly changing , with loanword use being an increasing trend ( Macalister , 2006a ; Kennedy and Yamazaki , 1999 ) .
However , the jury is still out regarding the reasons for the loanword use ( some hypotheses have been put forward ) , and the pat-
137terns of use across different genres ( it is unclear how language formality inﬂuences loanword use ) .
We ﬁnd that Twitter data complements the growing body of work on M ¯aori loanwords in NZE , by adding a combination of institutional and individual linguistic exchanges , in a non - editable online platform .
Social media language shares properties with both spoken and written language , but is not exactly like either .
More speciﬁcally , Twitter allows for creative expression and lexical innovation ( Grieve et al . , 2017 ) .
Our Twitter corpus was created by following three main steps : collecting tweets over a ten - year period using “ query words ” ( Section 3.1 ) , manually labelling thousands of randomly - sampled tweets as “ relevant ” or “ irrelevant ” ( Section 3.2 ) , and then training a classiﬁer to obtain automatic predictions for the relevance of each tweet and deploying this model on our target tweets , in a bid to ﬁlter out all those which are “ irrelevant ” ( Section 3.3 ) .
As will be discussed in Section 2 , our corpus is not the ﬁrst of its kind but is the ﬁrst corpus of New Zealand English tweets and the ﬁrst collection of online discourse built speciﬁcally to analyse the use of M ¯aori loanwords in NZE .
Section 4 outlines some preliminary ﬁndings from our corpus and Section 5 lays out plans for future work .
2 Related Work It is uncontroversial that M ¯aori loanwords are both productively used in NZE and increasing in popularity ( Macalister , 2006a ) .
The corpora analysed previously indicate that loanword use is highly skewed , with some language users leading the way – speciﬁcally M ¯aori women ( Calude et al . , 2017 ; Kennedy and Yamazaki , 1999 ) , and with certain topics of discourse drawing signiﬁcantly higher counts of loanwords than others – speciﬁcally those related to M ¯aori people and M ¯aori affairs , M¯aoritanga ( Degani , 2010 ) .
The type of loanwords being borrowed from M ¯aori is also changing .
During the ﬁrst wave of borrowing , some two - hundred years ago , many ﬂora and fauna words were being borrowed ; today , it is social culture terms that are increasingly adopted , e.g. , aroha ( love ) , whaea ( woman , teacher ) , and tangi ( M¯aori funeral ) , see Macalister ( 2006a ) .
However , the data available for loanword analysis is either outdated ( Calude et al . , 2017 ; Kennedy and Yamazaki , 1999 ) , or exclusively formal and highlyedited ( mainly newspaper language , Macalister 2006a ; Davies and Maclagan 2006 ; Degani 2010 ) , so little is known about M ¯aori loanwords in recent informal NZE interactions – a gap we hope to address here .
With the availability of vast amounts of data , building Twitter corpora has been a fruitful endeavour in various languages , including Turkish ( S ¸ims ¸ek and ¨Ozdemir , 2012 ; C ¸ etinoglu , 2016 ) , Greek ( Siﬁanou , 2015 ) , German ( Schefﬂer , 2014 ; Cieliebak et al . , 2017 ) , and ( American ) English ( Huang et al . , 2016 ) ( though notably , not New Zealand English , while a modest corpus of te reo M ¯aori tweets does exist , Keegan et al . 2015 ) .
Twitter corpora of mixed languages are tougher to collect because it is not straightforward to detect mixed language data automatically .
Geolocations can help to some extent , but they have limitations ( most users do not use them to begin with ) .
Recent work on Arabic has leveraged the presence of distinct scripts – the Roman and Arabic alphabet – to create a mixed language corpus ( V oss et al . , 2014 ) , but this option is not available to us .
M ¯aori has traditionally been a spoken ( only ) language , and was ﬁrst written down in the early 1800s by European missionaries in conjunction with M ¯aori language scholars , using the Roman alphabet ( Smyth , 1946 ) .
Our task is more similar to studies such as Das and Gamb ¨ack ( 2014 ) and C ¸ etinoglu ( 2016 ) , who aim to ﬁnd a mix of two languages which share the same script ( in their case , Hindi and English , and Turkish and German , respectively ) , but our method for collecting tweets is not user - based ; instead we use a set of target query words , as detailed in Section 3.1 .
3 The Corpus In this section , we describe the process of building the M ¯aori Loanword Twitter Corpus ( hereafter , the MLT Corpus ) 1 .
This process consists of three main steps , as depicted in Figure 1 . 3.1 Step 1 : Collecting Tweets
In order to facilitate the collection of relevant data for the MLT Corpus , we compiled a list of 116 target loanwords , which we will call “ query words ” .
1The corpus is available online at https : //kiwiwords.cms.waikato.ac.nz / corpus/ .
Note that we have only released the tweet IDs , together with a download script , in accordance with Twitter ’s terms and conditions .
We have also released the list of query words used .

Deploy   Model    1 .   Collect   Tweets     Target   Tweets   Figure 1 : The corpus - building process .
Most of these are individual words but some are short phrasal units ( tangata whenua , people of the land ; kapa haka , cultural performance ) .
The list is largely derived from Hay ( 2018 ) but was modiﬁed to exclude function words ( such as numerals ) and most proper nouns , except ﬁve that have native English counterparts : Aotearoa ( New Zealand ) , Kiwi(s ) ( New Zealander(s ) ) , M¯aori ( indigenous New Zealander ) , P¯akeh ¯a(European New Zealander ) , non - M ¯aori(non - indigenous New Zealander ) .
We also added three further loanwords which we deemed useful for increasing our data , namely haurangi ( drunk ) , wairangi ( drugged , confused ) , andp¯orangi ( crazy ) .
Using the Twitter Search API , we harvested 8 million tweets containing at least one query word ( after converting all characters to lowercase ) .
The tweets were collected diachronically over an eleven year period , between 2007 - 2018 .
We ensured that tweets were ( mostly ) written in English by using the lang : en parameter .
A number of exclusions and further adjustments were made .
With the aim of avoiding redundancy and uninformative data , retweets and tweets with URLs were discarded .
Tweets in which the query word was used as part of a username or mention ( e.g. , @happy kiwi ) were also discarded .
For those query words which contained macrons , we found that users were inconsistent in their macron use .
Consequently , we consolidated the data by adjusting our search to include both the macron and the non - macron version ( e.g. , both M¯aori and Maori ) .
We also removed all tweets containing fewer than ﬁve tokens ( words ) , due to insufﬁcient context of analysis .
Owing to relaxed spelling conventions on Twitter ( and also the use of hashtags ) , certain query words comprising multiple lexical items were stripped of spaces in order to harvest all variants of the phrasal units ( e.g. , kai moana andkaimoana ) .
Askaiwas itself a query word ( in its own right ) , we excluded tweets containing kai moana when searching for tweets containing kai(and repeatedthis process with similar items ) .
After inspecting these tweets , it was clear that a large number of our query words were polysemous ( or otherwise unrelated to NZE ) , and had introduced a signiﬁcant amount of noise into the data .
The four main challenges we encountered are described below .
First , because Twitter contains many different varieties of English , NZE being just one of these , it is not always straightforward to disentangle the dialect of English spoken in New Zealand from other dialects of English .
This could be a problem when , for instance , a M ¯aori word like Moana ( sea ) is used in American English tweets to denote the Disney movie ( or its main character ) .
Secondly , M ¯aori words have cognate forms with other Austronesian languages , such as Hawaiian , Samoan and Tongan , and many speakers of these languages live and work ( and tweet ) in New Zealand .
For instance , the word wahine ( woman ) has the same written form in M ¯aori and in Hawaiian .
But cognates are not the only problematic words .
Homographs with other , genealogically - unrelated languages can also pose problems .
For instance , the M ¯aori word hui(meeting ) is sometimes used as a proper noun in Chinese , as can be seen in the following tweet : “ Yo is Tay Peng Hui
okay with the tip of his ﬁnger ? ” .
Proper nouns constitute a third problematic aspect in our data .
As is typical for many language contact situations where an indigenous language shares the same geographical space as an incoming language , M ¯aori has contributed many place names and personal names to NZE , such as Timaru , Aoraki , Titirangi , H¯emi , Mere and so on .
While these proper nouns theoretically count as loanwords , we are less interested in them than in content words because the use of the former does not constitute a choice , whereas the use of the latter does ( in many cases ) .
The “ choice ” of whether to use a loanword or whether to use a native English word ( or sometimes a native English phrase ) is interesting to study because it provides insights
139into idiolectal lexical preferences ( which words different speakers or writers prefer in given contexts ) and relative borrowing success rates ( Calude et al . , 2017 ; Zenner et al . , 2012 ) .
Finally , given the impromptu and spontaneous nature of Twitter in general , we found that certain M ¯aori words coincided with misspelled versions of intended native English words , e.g. , whare ( house ) instead of where .
The resulting collection of tweets , termed the Original Dataset , was used to create the Raw Corpus , as explained below .
3.2 Step 2 : Manually Annotating Tweets
We decided to address the “ noisy ” tweets in our data using supervised machine learning .
Two coders manually inspected a random sample of 30 tweets for each query word , by checking the word ’s context of use , and labelled each tweet as “ relevant ” or “ irrelevant ” .
For example , a tweet like that in example ( 1 ) would be coded as relevant and one like “ awesome ! !
Congrats to Tangi :) ” , would be coded as irrelevant ( because the query word tangi is used as a proper noun ) .
Since 39 of the query words consistently yielded irrelevant tweets ( at least 90 % of the time ) , these ( and the tweets they occurred in ) were removed altogether from the data .
Our annotators produced a total of 3;685labelled tweets for the remaining 77 query words , which comprise the Labelled Corpus ( see Tables 1 and 4 ; note that irrelevant tweets have been removed from the latter for linguistic analysis ) .
Assuming our coded samples are representative of the real distribution of relevant / irrelevant tweets that occur with each query word , it makes sense to also discard the 39 “ noisy ” query words from our Original Dataset .
In this way , we created the ( unlabelled ) Raw Corpus , which is a ﬁfth of the size ( see Table 4 ) .
We computed an inter - rater reliability score for our two coders , based on a random sample of 200 tweets .
Using Cohen ’s Kappa , we calculated this value to be 0.87 ( “ strong ” ) .
In light of the strong agreement between the initial coders , no further coders were enlisted for the task .
3.3 Step 3 : Automatically Extracting Relevant Tweets
The next step was to train a classiﬁer using the Labelled Corpus as training data , so that the resulting model could be deployed on the Raw Corpus .
Ourgoal is to obtain automatic predictions for the relevance of each tweet in this corpus , according to probabilities given by our model .
We created ( stratiﬁed ) test and training sets that maintain the same proportion of relevant and irrelevant tweets associated with each query word in theLabelled Corpus .
We chose to include 80 % of these tweets in the training set and 20 % in the test set ( see Table 1 for a break - down of relevant and irrelevant instances ) .
Train Test Total Relevant 1;995 500 2 ; 495 Irrelevant 954 236 1 ; 190 Total 2;949 736 3 ; 685 Table 1 : Dataset statistics for our labelled tweets .
This Table shows the relevant , irrelevant and total number of instances ( i.e. , tweets ) in the independent training and test sets .
Using the AffectiveTweets package ( BravoMarquez et al . , 2019 ) , our labelled tweets were transformed into feature vectors based on the word n - grams they contain .
We then trained various classiﬁcation models on this transformed data in Weka ( Hall et al . , 2009 ) .
The models we tested were 1 ) Multinomial Naive Bayes ( McCallum et al . , 1998 ) with unigram attributes and 2 ) L2regularised logistic regression models with different word n - gram features , as implemented in LIBLINEAR2 .
We selected Multinomial Naive Bayes as the best model because it produced the highest AUC , Kappa and weighted average F - Score ( see Table 2 for a summary of results ) .
Overall , logistic regression with unigrams performed the worst , yielding ( slightly ) lower values for all three measures .
After deploying the Multinomial Naive Bayes model on the Raw Corpus , we found that 1,179,390 tweets were classiﬁed as relevant and 448,652 as irrelevant ( with probability threshold = 0.5 ) .
Table 3 shows examples from our corpus of each type of classiﬁcation .
Some tweets were falsely classiﬁed as “ irrelevant ” and some were falsely classiﬁed as “ relevant ” .
A short explanation why the irrelevant tweets were coded as such is given in brackets at the end of each tweet .
We removed all tweets classiﬁed as irrelevant , 2https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ ˜cjlin/ liblinear/

thereby producing the Processed Corpus .
A summary of all three corpora is given in Table 4 . 4 Preliminary Findings
As we are only just beginning to sift through the MLT Corpus , we note two particular sets of preliminary ﬁndings .
First , even though our corpus was primarily geared up to investigate loanword use , we are ﬁnding that , unlike other NZE genres analysed , the Twitter data exhibits use of M ¯aori which is more in line with code - switching than with loanword use , see ex .
( 2 - 3 ) .
This is particularly interesting in light of the reported increase in te reo M ¯aori language tweets ( Keegan et al . , 2015 ) .

We must really meet IRL when I get back to T ¯amaki Makaurau !
You have a fab day too !
( 3 ) Heh !
He porangi toku ngeru - especially at 5 in the morning ! !

I am well thank you .
Secondly , we also report the use of hybrid hashtags , that is , hashtags which contain a M ¯aori part and an English part , for example # mycrazywhanau , # reostories , # Matarikistar , # bringitonmana , # growingupkiwi , # kaitoputinmyfridge .
To our knowledge , these hybrid hashtags have never been analysed in the current literature .
Hybrid hashtags parallel the phenomenon of hybrid compounds discussed by Degani and Onysko ( 2010 ) .
Degani and Onysko report that hybrid compounds are both productive and semantically novel , showing that the borrowed words take on reconceptualised meanings in their adoptive language ( 2010 , p.231).Irrelevant tweets Relevant tweets f(x)<0.5 Classiﬁed irrelevantHaka ne !

5 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper introduced the ﬁrst purpose - built corpus of M ¯aori loanwords on Twitter , as well as a methodology for automatically ﬁltering out irrelevant data via machine learning .
The MLT Corpusopens up a myriad of opportunities for future work .
Since our corpus is a diachronic one ( i.e. , all tweets are time - stamped ) , we are planning to use it for testing hypotheses about language change .
This is especially desirable in the context of New Zealand English , which has recently undergone considerable change as it comes into the ﬁnal stage of dialect formation ( Schneider , 2003 ) .
Another avenue of future research is to automatically identify other M ¯aori loanwords that are not part of our initial list of query words .
This could
141be achieved by deploying a language detector tool on every unique word in the corpus ( Martins and Silva , 2005 ) .
The “ discovered ” words could be used as new query words to further expand our corpus .
In addition , we intend to explore the meaning of our M ¯aori loanwords using distributional semantic models .
We will train popular word embeddings algorithms on the MLT Corpus , such as Word2Vec ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) and FastText ( Bojanowski et al . , 2017 ) , and identify words that are close to our loanwords in the semantic space .
We predict that these neighbouring words will enable us to understand the semantic make - up of our loanwords according to their usage .
Finally , we hope to extrapolate these ﬁndings by deploying our trained classiﬁer on other online discourse sources , such as Reddit posts .
This has great potential for enriching our understanding of how M ¯aori loanwords are used in social media .
