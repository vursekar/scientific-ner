However , researchers have mainly poured attention to knowledge inference on binary facts .
The studies on n - ary facts are relatively scarcer , although they are also ubiquitous in the real world .
Therefore , this paper addresses knowledge inference on n - ary facts .
We represent each n - ary fact as a primary triple coupled with a set of its auxiliary descriptive attribute - value pair(s ) .
We further propose a neural network model , NeuInfer , for knowledge inference on n - ary facts .
Besides handling the common task to infer an unknown element in a whole fact , NeuInfer can cope with a new type of task , ﬂexible knowledge inference .
It aims to infer an unknown element in a partial fact consisting of the primary triple coupled with any number of its auxiliary description(s ) .
Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable superiority of NeuInfer .
1 Introduction With the introduction of connotative valid facts , knowledge inference on knowledge graph improves the performance of many downstream applications , such as vertical search and question answering ( Dong et al . , 2015 ; Lukovnikov et al . , 2017 ) .
Existing studies ( Nickel et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ) mainly focus on knowledge inference on binary facts with two entities connected with a certain binary relation , represented as triples , ( head entity , relation , tail entity ) .
They attempt to infer the unknown head / tail entity or the unknown relation of a given binary fact .
However , n - ary facts involving more than two entities are also ubiquitous .
For example , in Freebase , more than 1=3entities participate in n - ary facts ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) .
Thefact thatJohnBardeen receivedNobelPrizein Physics in1956 together with WalterHouser Brattain andWilliamShockley1is a typical 5ary fact .
So far , only a few studies ( Wen et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2018 ; Guan et al . , 2019 ) have tried to address knowledge inference on n - ary facts .
In existing studies for knowledge inference on nary facts , each n - ary fact is represented as a group of peer attributes and attribute values .
In practice , for each n - ary fact , there is usually a primary triple ( the main focus of the n - ary fact ) , and other attributes along with the corresponding attribute values are its auxiliary descriptions .
Take the above 5 - ary fact for example , the primary triple is ( JohnBardeen;award -received;Nobel Prize in Physics ) , and other attribute - value pairs includingpoint -in - time : 1956 , together -with : Walter Houser Brattain andtogether -with : WilliamShockley are its auxiliary descriptions .
Actually , in YAGO ( Suchanek et al . , 2007 ) and Wikidata ( Vrande ˇci´c and Kr ¨otzsch , 2014 ) , a primary triple is identiﬁed for each n - ary fact .
The above 5 - ary fact is a relatively complete example .
In the real - world scenario , many n - ary facts appear as only partial ones , each consisting of a primary triple and a subset of its auxiliary description(s ) , due to incomplete knowledge acquisition .
For example , ( JohnBardeen;award received;NobelPrizeinPhysics ) withpoint in - time : 1956 and it withftogether -with : Walter Houser Brattain ; together -with : WilliamShockley gare two typical partial facts corresponding to the above 5 - ary fact .
For differentiation , we call those relatively complete facts as whole ones .
We noticed that existing studies on n - ary facts infer an unknown element in a welldeﬁned whole fact and have not paid attention to knowledge inference on partial facts .
Later on , we 1https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q949
6142refer the former as simple knowledge inference , while the latter as ﬂexible knowledge inference .
With these considerations in mind , in this paper , by discriminating the information in the same n - ary fact , we propose a neural network model , called NeuInfer , to conduct both simple and ﬂexible knowledge inference on n - ary facts .
Our speciﬁc contributions are summarized as : •We treat the information in the same n - ary fact discriminatingly and represent each n - ary fact as a primary triple coupled with a set of its auxiliary descriptive attribute - value pair(s ) .
•We propose a neural network model , NeuInfer , for knowledge inference on n - ary facts .
NeuInfer can particularly handle the new type of task , ﬂexible knowledge inference , which infers an unknown element in a partial fact consisting of a primary triple and any number of its auxiliary description(s ) .
•Experimental results validate the signiﬁcant effectiveness and superiority of NeuInfer .
2 Related Works 2.1 Knowledge Inference on Binary Facts They can be divided into tensor / matrix based methods , translation based methods , and neural network based ones .
The quintessential one of tensor / matrix based methods is RESCAL ( Nickel et
al . , 2011 ) .
It relates a knowledge graph to a three - way tensor of head entities , relations , and tail entities .
The learned embeddings of entities and relations via minimizing the reconstruction error of the tensor are used to reconstruct the tensor .
And binary facts corresponding to entries of large values are treated as valid .
Similarly , ComplEx ( Trouillon et al . , 2016 ) relates each relation to a matrix of head and tail entities , which is decomposed and learned like RESCAL .
To improve the embeddings and thus the performance of inference , researchers further introduce the constraints of entities and relations ( Ding et al . , 2018 ; Jain et al . , 2018 ) .
Translation based methods date back to TransE ( Bordes et al . , 2013 ) .
It views each valid binary fact as the translation from the head entity to the tail entity via their relation .
Thus , the score function indicating the validity of the fact is deﬁned based on the similarity between the translation result and the tail entity .
Then , a ﬂurry of methodsspring up ( Wang et al . , 2014 ; Lin et al . , 2015b ; Ji et al . , 2015 ; Guo et al . , 2015 ; Lin et al . , 2015a ; Xiao et al . , 2016 ; Jia et al . , 2016 ; Tay et al . , 2017 ; Ebisu and Ichise , 2018 ; Chen et al . , 2019 ) .
They modify the above translation assumption or introduce additional information and constraints .
Among them , TransH ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) translates on relationspeciﬁc hyperplanes .
Entities are projected into the hyperplanes of relations before translating .
Neural network based methods model the validity of binary facts or the inference processes .
For example , ConvKB ( Nguyen et al . , 2018 ) treats each binary fact as a three - column matrix .
This matrix is fed into a convolution layer , followed by a concatenation layer and a fully - connected layer to generate a validity score .
Nathani et al .
( 2019 ) further proposes a generalized graph attention model as the encoder to capture neighborhood features and applies ConvKB as the decoder .
ConvE ( Dettmers et al . , 2018 ) models entity inference process via 2D convolution over the reshaped then concatenated embedding of the known entity and relation .
ConvR ( Jiang et al . , 2019 ) further adaptively constructs convolution ﬁlters from relation embedding and applies these ﬁlters across entity embedding to generate convolutional features .
SENN ( Guan et al . , 2018 ) models the inference processes of head entities , tail entities , and relations via fullyconnected neural networks , and integrates them into a uniﬁed framework .
2.2 Knowledge Inference on N - ary Facts As aforesaid , only a few studies handle this type of knowledge inference .
The m - TransH method ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) deﬁnes n - ary relations as the mappings from the attribute sequences to the attribute values .
Each n - ary fact is an instance of the corresponding n - ary relation .
Then , m - TransH generalizes TransH ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) on binary facts to nary facts via attaching each n - ary relation with a hyperplane .
RAE ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) further introduces the likelihood that two attribute values co - participate in a common n - ary fact , and adds the corresponding relatedness loss multiplied by a weight factor to the embedding loss of m - TransH. Speciﬁcally , RAE applies a fully - connected neural network to model the above likelihood .
Differently , NaLP ( Guan et al . , 2019 ) represents each n - ary fact as a set of attribute - value pairs directly .
Then , convolution is adopted to get the embeddings of the attribute - value pairs , and a fully - connected neural
6143network is applied to evaluate their relatedness and ﬁnally to obtain the validity score of the input n - ary fact .
In these methods , the information in the same n - ary fact is equal - status .
Actually , in each n - ary fact , a primary triple can usually be identiﬁed with other information as its auxiliary description(s ) , as exempliﬁed in Section 1 .
Moreover , these methods are deliberately designed only for the inference on whole facts .
They have not tackled any distinct inference task .
In practice , the newly proposed ﬂexible knowledge inference is also prevalent .
3 Problem Statement 3.1 The Representation of N - ary Facts Different from the studies that deﬁne n - ary relations ﬁrst
and then represent n - ary facts ( Wen et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et
al . , 2018 ) , we represent each n - ary fact as a primary triple ( head entity , relation , tail entity ) coupled with a set of its auxiliary description(s ) directly .
Formally , given an n - ary fact Fct with the primary triple ( h;r;t ) , mattributes and attribute values , its representation is :   ( h;r ; t ) ; f j  a1 : v1 ; j  a2 : v2 ; j   : : : ; j  am : vmg ; where eachai : vi(i= 1;2;:::;m ) is an attributevalue pair , also called an auxiliary description to the primary triple .
An element of Fct refers to h / r / t / ai / vi;AFct = fa1;a2;:::;a mgisFct ’s attribute set and aimay be the same to aj(i;j= 1;2;:::;m;i6 = j);VFct = fv1;v2;:::;v mgis Fct ’s attribute value set .
For example , the representation of the 5 - ary fact , mentioned in Section 1 , is :   ( John Bardeen ; award -received ; Nobel Prize in Physics ) ; f j  point -in - time : 1956 ; j  together -with : Walter Houser Brattain ; j  together -with : William Shockley g :
Note that , in the real world , there is a type of complicated cases , say , where more than two entities participate in the same n - ary fact with the same primary attribute .
We follow Wikidata ( Vrande ˇci´c and Kr ¨otzsch , 2014 ) to view the cases from different aspects of different entities .
Take the case thatJohnBardeen , WalterHouserBrattain , andWilliamShockley receivedNobelPrizein Physics in1956 for example , besides the above 5 - ary fact from the view of John Bardeen , we get other two 5 - ary facts from the views of Walter HouserBrattain2andWilliamShockley3 , respectively :   ( Walter Houser Brattain ; award -received ; Nobel Prize in Physics ) ; f j  point -in - time : 1956 ; j  together -with : John Bardeen ; j  together -with : William Shockley g :   ( William Shockley ; award -received ; Nobel Prize in Physics ) ; f j  point -in - time : 1956 ; j  together -with : Walter Houser Brattain ; j  together -with : John Bardeeng : 3.2 Task Statement In this paper , we handle both the common simple knowledge inference and the newly proposed ﬂexible knowledge inference .
Before giving their deﬁnitions under our representation form of n - ary facts , let us deﬁne whole fact and partial fact ﬁrst .
Deﬁnition 1 ( Whole fact and partial fact ) .
For the factFct , assume its set of auxiliary description(s ) asSd = fai : viji= 1;2;:::;mg .
Then a partial fact ofFctis : Fct0=  ( h;r;t ) ; S0 d , whereS0 d Sd , i.e. ,S0 dis a subset of Sd .
And we call Fctthe whole fact to differentiate it from Fct0 .
Notably , whole fact and partial fact are relative concepts , and a whole fact is a relatively complete fact compared to its partial fact .
In this paper , partial facts are introduced to imitate a typical openworld setting where different facts of the same type may have different numbers of attribute - value pair(s ) .
Deﬁnition 2 ( Simple knowledge inference ) .
It aims to infer an unknown element in a whole fact .
Deﬁnition 3 ( Flexible knowledge inference ) .
It aims to infer an unknown element in a partial fact .
4 The NeuInfer Method 4.1 The Framework of NeuInfer To conduct knowledge inference on n - ary facts , NeuInfer ﬁrst models the validity of the n - ary facts and then casts inference as a classiﬁcation task .

4.1.1
The Motivation of NeuInfer How to estimate whether an n - ary fact is valid or not ?
Let us look into two typical examples of invalid n - ary facts :   ( John Bardeen ; award -received ; Turing Award ) ; f j  point -in - time : 1956 ; j  together -with :
Walter Houser Brattain ; j  together -with : William Shockley g :   ( John Bardeen ; award -received ; Nobel Prize in Physics ) ; f j  point -in - time : 1956 ; j  together -with : Walter Houser Brattain ; j  place -of - marriage : New Y ork Cityg :
In the above ﬁrst n - ary fact , the primary triple is invalid .
In the second one , some auxiliary description is incompatible with the primary triple .
Therefore , we believe that a valid n - ary fact has two prerequisites .
On the one hand , its primary triple should be valid .
If the primary triple is invalid , attaching any number of attribute - value pairs to it does not make the resulting n - ary fact valid ; on the other hand , since each auxiliary description presents a qualiﬁer to the primary triple , it should be compatible with the primary triple .
Even if the primary triple is basically valid , any incompatible attribute - value pair makes the n - ary fact invalid .
Therefore , NeuInfer is designed to characterize these two aspects and thus consists of two components corresponding to the validity evaluation of the primary triple and the compatibility evaluation of the n - ary fact , respectively.4.1.2 The Framework of NeuInfer The framework of NeuInfer is illustrated in Figure 1 , with the 5 - ary fact presented in Section 1 as an example .
For an n - ary fact Fct , we look up the embeddings of its relation rand the attributes in AFct from the embedding matrix MR2RjRjkof relations and attributes , where Ris the set of all the relations and attributes , and kis the dimension of the latent vector space .
The embeddings of h , t , and the attribute values in VFctare looked up from the embedding matrix ME2RjEjkof entities and attribute values , where Eis the set of all the entities and attribute values .
In what follows , the embeddings are denoted with the same letters but in boldface by convention .
As presented in Figure 1 , these embeddings are fed into the validity evaluation component ( the upper part of Figure 1 ) and the compatibility evaluation component ( the bottom part of Figure 1 ) to compute the validity score of ( h;r;t ) and the compatibility score of Fct , respectively .
These two scores are used to generate the ﬁnal score of Fctby weighted sumand further compute the loss .
Note that , following RAE ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) and NaLP ( Guan et al . , 2019 ) , we only apply fully - connected neural networks in NeuInfer .
4.2 Validity Evaluation This component estimates the validity of ( h;r;t ) , including the acquisition of its interaction vector and the assessment of its validity , corresponding to “ hrt - FCNs ” and “ FCN 1 ” in Figure 1 , respectively .
Detailedly , the embeddings of h , r , andtare
6145concatenated and fed into a fully - connected neural network .
After layer - by - layer learning , the last layer outputs the interaction vector ohrtof(h;r;t ): ohrt = f(f(f(f([h;r;t]W1;1+b1;1) W1;2+b1;2))W1;n1+b1;n1);(1 ) wheref()is
the ReLU function ; n1is the number of the neural network layers ; fW1;1;W1;2 ; : : : ; W1;n1gandfb1;1;b1;2;:::;b1;n1gare their weight matrices and bias vectors , respectively .
Withohrtas the input , the validity score valhrt of(h;r;t ) is computed via a fully - connected layer and then the sigmoid operation : valhrt=(ohrtWval+bval ) ; ( 2 ) where Wvalandbvalare the weight matrix and bias variable , respectively ; (x ) = 1 1+e xis the sigmoid function , which constrains valhrt2(0;1 ) .
For simplicity , the number of hidden nodes in each fully - connected layer of “ hrt - FCNs ” and “ FCN 1 ” gradually reduces with the same difference between layers .
4.3 Compatibility Evaluation This component estimates the compatibility of Fct .
It contains three sub - processes , i.e. , the capture of the interaction vector between ( h;r;t ) and each auxiliary description ai : vi(i= 1;2;:::;m ) , the acquisition of the overall interaction vector , and the assessment of the compatibility of Fct , corresponding to “ hrtav - FCNs ” , “ min ” and “ FCN 2 ” in Figure 1 , respectively .
Similar to “ hrt - FCNs ” , we obtain the interaction vector ohrta iviof(h;r;t ) andai : vi : ohrta ivi = f(f(f(f([h;r;t;ai;vi]W2;1+b2;1) W2;2+b2;2))W2;n2+b2;n2 ) ; ( 3 ) wheren2is the number of the neural network layers;fW2;1;W2;2;:::;W2;n2gandfb2;1 ; b2;2;:::;b2;n2gare their weight matrices and bias vectors , respectively .
The number of hidden nodes in each fully - connected layer also gradually reduces with the same difference between layers .
And the dimension of the resulting ohrta iviisd .
All the auxiliary descriptions share the same parameters in this sub - process .
The overall interaction vector ohrtav ofFctis generated based on ohrta ivi .
Before introducing this sub - process , let us see the principle behind ﬁrst .
Straightforwardly , if Fctis valid , ( h;r;t ) should be compatible with any of its auxiliary description .
Then , the values of their interaction vector , measuring the compatibility in many different views , are all encouraged to be large .
Therefore , for each dimension , the minimum over it of all the interaction vectors is not allowed to be too small .
Thus , the overall interaction vector ohrtav of ( h;r;t ) and its auxiliary description(s ) is : ohrtav = minm i=1(ohrta ivi ) ; ( 4 ) where min()is the element - wise minimizing function .
Then , similar to “ FCN 1 ” , we obtain the compatibility scorecompFctofFct : compFct=(ohrtavWcomp + bcomp);(5 ) where Wcomp of dimension d1andbcomp are the weight matrix and bias variable , respectively .
4.4 Final Score and Loss Function The ﬁnal score sFctofFctis the weighted sum  of the above validity score and compatibility score : sFct = valhrtcompFct = wvalhrt+ ( 1 w)compFct;(6 ) wherew2(0;1)is the weight factor .
If the arity of Fctis 2 , the ﬁnal score is equal to the validity score of the primary triple ( h;r;t ) .
Then , Equation ( 6 ) is reduced to : sFct = valhrt : ( 7 ) Currently , we obtain the ﬁnal score sFctofFct .
In addition , Fcthas its target score lFct .
By comparingsFctwithlFct , we get the binary crossentropy loss : LFct= lFctlogsFct (1 lFct ) log(1 sFct);(8 ) wherelFct= 1 , ifFct2 T , otherwiseFct2T  , lFct= 0 .
Here , Tis the training set and T is the set of negative samples constructed by corrupting the n - ary facts in T. Speciﬁcally , for each n - ary fact inT , we randomly replace one of its elements with a random element in E / Rto generate one negative sample not contained in T.
We then optimize NeuInfer via backpropagation , and Adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) with learning rateis used as the optimizer .
61465 Experiments 5.1 Datasets and Metrics We conduct experiments on two n - ary datasets .
The ﬁrst one is JF17 K ( Wen et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et
al . , 2018 ) , derived from Freebase ( Bollacker et al . , 2008 ) .
In JF17 K , an n - ary relation of a certain type is deﬁned by a ﬁxed number of ordered attributes .
Then , any n - ary fact of this relation is denoted as an ordered sequence of attribute values corresponding to the attributes .
For example , for all n - ary facts of the n - ary relation olympics : olympic medalhonor , they all have four attribute values ( e.g. , 2008 Summer Olympics , United States , Natalie Coughlin , andSwimming at the 2008 SummerOlympics – Women0s4100metre freestyle relay ) , corresponding to the four ordered attributes of this n - ary relation .
The second one is WikiPeople ( Guan et al . , 2019 ) , derived from Wikidata ( Vrande ˇci´c and Kr ¨otzsch , 2014 ) .
Its n - ary facts are more diverse than JF17 K ’s .
For example , for all n - ary facts that narrateaward -received , some have the attribute together -with , while some others do not .
Thus , WikiPeople is more difﬁcult .
To run NeuInfer on JF17 K and WikiPeople , we transform the representation of their n - ary facts .
For JF17 K , we need to convert each attribute value sequence of a speciﬁc n - ary relation to a primary triple coupled with a set of its auxiliary description(s ) .
The core of this process is to determine the primary triple , formed by merging the two primary attributes of the n - ary relation and the corresponding attribute values .
The two primary attributes are selected based on RAE ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) .
For each attribute of the n - ary relation , we count the number of its distinct attribute values from all the n - ary facts of this relation .
The two attributes that correspond to the largest and second - largest numbers are chosen as the two primary attributes .
For WikiPeople , since there is a primary triple for each n - ary fact in Wikidata , with its help , we simply reorganize a set of attribute - value pairs in WikiPeople to a primary triple coupled with a set of its auxiliary description(s ) .
The statistics of the datasets after conversion or reorganization are outlined in Table 1 , where # Train , # Valid , and # Test are the sizes of the training set , validation set , and test set , respectively .
As for metrics , we adopt the standard Mean Re - DatasetjRjjEj#Train # V alid # Test JF17 K 501 28,645 76,379 - 24,568 WikiPeople 193 47,765 305,725 38,223 38,281 Table 1 : The statistics of the datasets .
ciprocal Rank ( MRR ) and Hits@ N.
For each n - ary test fact , one of its elements is removed and replaced by all the elements in E / R. These corrupted n - ary facts are fed into NeuInfer to obtain the ﬁnal scores .
Based on these scores , the n - ary facts are sorted in descending order , and the rank of the n - ary test fact is stored .
Note that , except the nary test fact , other corrupted n - ary facts existing in the training / validation / test set , are discarded before sorting .
This process is repeated for all other elements of the n - ary test fact .
Then , MRR is the average of these reciprocal ranks , and Hits@ Nis the proportion of the ranks less than or equal to N. Knowledge inference includes entity inference and relation inference .
As presented in Table 1 , the number of relations and attributes in each dataset is far less than that of entities and attribute values ( on JF17K , jRj= 501 , whilejEj= 28;645 ; on WikiPeople , jRj= 193 , whilejEj= 47;765 ) .
That is , inferring a relation / attribute is much simpler than inferring an entity / attribute value .
Therefore , we adopt MRR and Hits@ f1 , 3 , 10gon entity inference , while pouring attention to more ﬁnegrained metrics , i.e. , MRR and Hits@1 on relation inference .
5.2 Experimental Settings The hyper - parameters of NeuInfer are tuned via grid search in the following ranges : The embedding dimension k2f50;100 g , the batch size  2f128;256 g , the learning rate 2f5e 6 ; 1e 5;5e 5;1e 4;5e 4;1e 3 g , the numbers n1 andn2of the neural network layers of “ hrt - FCNs ” and “ hrtav - FCNs ” in f1;2 g , the dimension dof the interaction vector ohrta iviinf50;100;200;400 ; 500;800;1000;1200 g , the weight factor wof the scores inf0:1;0:2 ; : : : ; 0:9 g.

the primary triple or the attribute value / attribute in an auxiliary description , given its other information .
5.3.1 Baselines Knowledge inference methods on n - ary facts are scarce .
The representative methods are mTransH ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) and its modiﬁed version RAE ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) , and the state - of - the - art one is NaLP ( Guan et
al . , 2019 ) .
As m - TransH is worse than RAE , following NaLP , we do not adopt it as a baseline .
5.3.2 Simple Entity Inference
The experimental results of simple entity inference are reported in Table 2 .
From the results , it can be observed that NeuInfer performs much better than the best baseline NaLP , which veriﬁes the superiority of NeuInfer .
Speciﬁcally , on JF17 K , the performance gap between NeuInfer and NaLP is signiﬁcant .
In essence , 0.151 on MRR , 14.6 % on Hits@1 , 16.2 % on Hits@3 , and 15.9 % on Hits@10 .
On WikiPeople , NeuInfer also outperforms NaLP .
It testiﬁes the strength of NeuInfer treating the information in the same n - ary fact discriminatingly .
By differentiating the primary triple from other auxiliary description(s ) , NeuInfer considers the validity of the primary triple and the compatibility between the primary triple and its auxiliary description(s ) to model each n - ary fact more appropriately and reasonably .
Thus , it is not surprising that NeuInfer beats the baselines .
And on simpler JF17 K ( see Section 5.1 ) , NeuInfer gains more signiﬁcant performance improvement than on WikiPeople .
5.3.3 Simple Relation Inference Since RAE is deliberately developed only for simple entity inference , we compare NeuInfer only with NaLP on simple relation inference .
Table 3 demonstrates the experimental results of simple relation inference .
From the table , we can observe that NeuInfer outperforms NaLP consistently .
Detailedly , on JF17 K , the performance improvement of NeuInfer on MRR and Hits@1 is 0.036 and 7.0 % , respectively ; on WikiPeople , they are 0.030and 9.1 % , respectively .
It is ascribed to the reasonable modeling of n - ary facts , which not only improves the performance of simple entity inference but also is beneﬁcial to pick the exact right relations / attributes out .

5.4 Ablation Study We perform an ablation study to look deep into the framework of NeuInfer .
If we remove the compatibility evaluation component , NeuInfer is reduced to a method for binary but not n - ary facts .
Since we handle knowledge inference on n - ary facts , it is inappropriate to remove this component .
Thus , as an ablation , we only deactivate the validity evaluation component , denoted as NeuInfer . The experimental comparison between NeuInfer and NeuInfer  is illustrated in Figure 2 .
It can be observed from the ﬁgure that NeuInfer outperforms NeuInfer  signiﬁcantly .
It suggests that the validity evaluation component plays a pivotal role in our method .
Thus , each component of our method is necessary .
5.5 Flexible Knowledge Inference The newly proposed ﬂexible knowledge inference focuses on n - ary facts of arities greater than 2 .
It includes ﬂexible entity inference and ﬂexible relation inference .
For an n - ary fact , they infer one of the entities / the relation in the primary triple given any number of its auxiliary description(s ) or infer the attribute value / attribute in an auxiliary description given the primary triple and any number of other auxiliary description(s ) .
In existing knowledge inference methods on n - ary facts , each n - ary fact is represented as a group of peer attributes and attribute values .
These methods have not poured attention to the above ﬂexible knowledge inference .
Thus , we conduct this new type of task only on

NeuInfer .
Before elaborating on the experimental results , let us look into the new test set used in this section ﬁrst .
5.5.1
The New Test Set We generate the new test set as follows : •Collect the n - ary facts of arities greater than 2 from the test set .
•For each collected n - ary fact , compute all the subsets of the auxiliary description(s ) .
The primary triple and each subset form a new n - ary fact , which is added to the candidate set .
•Remove the n - ary facts that also exist in the training / validation set from the candidate set and then remove the duplicate n - ary facts .
The remaining n - ary facts form the new test set .
The size of the resulting new test set on JF17 K is 34,784 , and that on WikiPeople is 13,833 .
5.5.2 Flexible Entity and Relation Inference
The experimental results of ﬂexible entity and relation inference on these new test sets are presented in Table 4 .
It can be observed that NeuInfer well tackles ﬂexible entity and relation inference on partial facts , and achieves excellent performance .
We also attribute this to the reasonable modeling of n - ary facts .
For each n - ary fact , NeuInfer distinguishes the primary triple from other auxiliarydescription(s ) and models them properly .
Thus , NeuInfer well handles various types of entity and relation inference concerning the primary triple coupled with any number of its auxiliary description(s ) .
5.6 Performance under Different Scenarios To further analyze the effectiveness of the proposed NeuInfer method , we look into the breakdown of its performance on different arities , as well as on primary triples and auxiliary descriptions .
Without loss of generality , here we report only the experimental results on simple entity inference .
The test sets are grouped into binary and n - ary ( n>2 ) categories according to the arities of the facts .
Table 5 presents the experimental results of simple entity inference on these two categories of JF17 K and WikiPeople .
From the tables , we can observe that NeuInfer consistently outperforms the baselines on both categories on simpler JF17K.
On more difﬁcult WikiPeople , NeuInfer is comparable to the best baseline NaLP on the binary category and gains much better performance on the n - ary category in terms of the ﬁne - grained MRR and Hits@1 .
In general , NeuInfer performs much better on JF17 K than on WikiPeople .
We attribute this to the simplicity of JF17K. Where does the above performance improvement come from ?
Is it from inferring the head / tail

entities in primary triples or the attribute values in auxiliary descriptions ?
To go deep into it , we study the performance of NeuInfer on inferring the head / tail entities and the attribute values and compare it with the best baseline NaLP .
The detailed experimental results are demonstrated in Tables 6 and 7 .
It can be observed that NeuInfer brings more performance gain on inferring attribute values .
It indicates that combining the validity of the primary triple and the compatibility between the primary triple and its auxiliary description(s ) to model each n - ary fact is more effective than only considering the relatedness of attribute - value pairs in NaLP , especially for inferring attribute values .
6 Conclusions In this paper , we distinguished the information in the same n - ary fact and represented each n - ary fact as a primary triple coupled with a set of its auxiliary description(s ) .
We then proposed a neural network model , NeuInfer , for knowledge inference on n - ary facts .
NeuInfer combines the validity evaluation of the primary triple and the compatibility evaluation of the n - ary fact to obtain the validity score of the n - ary fact .
In this way , NeuInfer has the ability of well handling simple knowledge inference , which copes with the inference on wholefacts .
Furthermore , NeuInfer is capable of dealing with the newly proposed ﬂexible knowledge inference , which tackles the inference on partial facts consisting of a primary triple coupled with any number of its auxiliary descriptive attributevalue pair(s ) .
Experimental results manifest the merits and superiority of NeuInfer .
Particularly , on simple entity inference , NeuInfer outperforms the state - of - the - art method signiﬁcantly in terms of all the metrics .
NeuInfer improves the performance of Hits@3 even by 16.2 % on JF17K.
In this paper , we use only n - ary facts in the datasets to conduct knowledge inference .
For future works , to further improve the method , we will explore the introduction of additional information , such as rules and external texts .
