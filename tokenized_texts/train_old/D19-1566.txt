pb g@iitp.ac.in Abstract In recent times , multi - modal analysis has been an emerging and highly sought - after ﬁeld at the intersection of natural language processing , computer vision , and speech processing .
The prime objective of such studies is to leverage the diversiﬁed information , ( e.g. , textual , acoustic and visual ) , for learning a model .
The effective interaction among these modalities often leads to a better system in terms of performance .
In this paper , we introduce a recurrent neural network based approach for the multi - modal sentiment and emotion analysis .
The proposed model learns the inter - modal interaction among the participating modalities through an auto - encoder mechanism .
We employ a context - aware attention module to exploit the correspondence among the neighboring utterances .
We evaluate our proposed approach for ﬁve standard multi - modal affect analysis datasets .
Experimental results suggest the efﬁcacy of the proposed model for both sentiment and emotion analysis over various existing state - of - the - art systems .
1 Introduction In recent past , the world has witnessed tremendous growth of various social media platforms , e.g. , YouTube , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , etc .
People treat these platforms as a communication medium and freely express themselves with the help of a diverse set of input sources , e.g. videos , images , audio , textetc .
The amount of information produced daily through these mediums are enormous , and hence , the research on multi - modal information processing has attracted attention to the researchers and developers .
A video is a multimodal input which provides visual , acoustic , and textual information .
The motivation of multi - modal sentiment and emotion analysis lies in fact to leverage the varieties of ( often distinct ) information from multiplesources for building more efﬁcient systems .
For some cases , text can provide a better clue for the prediction , whereas for the others , acoustic or visual sources can be more informative .
Similarly , in some situations , a combination of two or more information sources together ensures better and unambiguous classiﬁcation decision .
For example , only text ” shut up ” can not decide the mood of a person but acoustic ( tone of a person ) andvisual ( expression of a person ) can reveal the exact mood .
Similarly , for some instances visual features such as gesture , postures , facial expression etc . have important roles to play in determining the correctness of the system .
However , effectively combining this information is a nontrivial task that researchers often have to face ( Poria et al . , 2016 ; Ranganathan et al . , 2016 ; Lee et al . , 2018 ) .
Traditionally , ‘ text ’ has been the key factor in any Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) tasks , including sentiment and emotion analysis .
However , with the recent emergence of social media platforms , an interdisciplinary study involving text , visual andacoustic features have drawn a great interest among the research community .
Expressing the feelings and emotions through a video is much convenient than the text for a user , and it is the best source to extract all multi - modal information .
Not only the visual , it also provides other information such as acoustic andtextual representation of spoken language .
Additionally , a single video can have multiple utterances based on a speaker ’s pause ( speech bounded by breaths ) with different sentiments and emotions .
The sentiments and emotions of an utterance often have interdependence on the other contextual utterances .
Independently classifying such an utterance poses several challenges to the underlying problem .
In contrast , multi - modal sentiment and emotion analysis take inputs from more than one sources e.g.
5648text , visual , acoustic for the analysis .
Effectively fusing this diverse information is non - trivial and poses several challenges to the underlying problem .
In our current work , we propose an end - to - end Context - aware Interactive Attention ( CIA ) based recurrent neural network for sentiment and emotion analysis .
We aim to leverage the interaction between the modalities to increase the conﬁdence of individual task in prediction .
The main contributions of our current research are as follows : ( 1)We propose an Inter - modal Interactive Module ( IIM ) that aims to learn the interaction among the diverse and distinct features of the input modalities , i.e. , text , acoustic and visual ; ( 2)We employ a Context - aware Attention Module ( CAM ) that identiﬁes and assigns the weights to the neighboring utterances based on their contributing features .
It exploits the interactive representations of pairwise modalities to learn the attention weights , and ( 3)We present new state - of - the - arts for ﬁve benchmark datasets for both sentiment and emotion predictions .

In comparison to the existing systems , our proposed approach aims to exploits the interaction between the input modalities through an autoencoder based inter - modal interactive module .
The interactive module learns the joint representation for the participating modalities , which are further utilized to capture the contributing contextual utterances in a context - aware attention module .
3 Context - aware Interactive Attention ( CIA ) Affect Analysis In this section , we describe our proposed approach for the effective fusion of multi - modal input sources .
We propose an end - to - end Contextaware Interactive Attention ( CIA ) based recurrent neural network for sentiment and emotion analysis .
As discussed earlier , one of the main challenges for multi - modal information analysis is to exploit the interaction among the input modalities .
Therefore , we introduce an Inter - modal Interactive Module ( IIM ) that aims to learn the interaction between any two modalities through an auto - encoder like structure .
For the text - acoustic pair of modalities , we aim to decode the acoustic representation through the encoded textual representation .
After training of IIM , we extract the encoded representation for further processing .
We argue that the encoded representation learns the interaction between the textandacoustic modalities .
Similarly , we compute the interaction among all the other pairs ( i.e. , acoustic - text , text - visual , visualtext , acoustic - visual , and visual - acoustic ) .
Next , we extract the sequential pattern of the utterances through a Bi - directional Gated Recurrent Unit ( BiGRU ) ( Cho et al . , 2014 ) ) .
For each pair of modalities , the two representations denoting the interactions between them are combined through a mean operation .
For an instance , we compute the mean of the text - acoustic andacoustic - text representations for text and acoustic modalities .
The mean operation ensures that the network utilizes the two distinct representations by keeping the minimal dimension .
In our network , we , additionally , learn the interaction among the modalities through a feedforward network .
At ﬁrst , all the three modalities are passed through a separate Bi - GRU .
Then , pair - Algorithm 1 Inter - modal Interactive Module for Multi - modal Sentiment and Emotion Recognition ( IIM - MMSE ) procedure IIM - MMSE ( t ; v ; a ) fori21 ; : : : ; K do .

pair .
The attention module assists the network in attending the contributing features by putting weights to the current and the neighboring utterances in a video .
In the end , the pair - wise ( i.e. , text - acoustic , text - visual , and acoustic - visual ) attended representations are concatenated and fed to an output layer for the prediction .
We depict and summarize the proposed approach in Figure 1 and Algorithm 1 , 2 , and 3 .
The source code is available at http://www.iitp .
ac.in/ ˜ai - nlp - ml / resources.html .
3.1 Context - aware Attention Module ( CAM ) Since the utterances in a video are the split units of the break / pause of the speech , their emotions ( or sentiments ) often have relations with their neighboring utterances .
Therefore , knowledge of the emotions ( or , sentiments ) of the neighboring utterances is an important piece of information and has the capability to derive the prediction of an utterance , if the available inputs are insufﬁcient for the correct prediction .
Our proposed context - aware attention module leverages the contextual information .
For eachutterance in a video , we compute the attention weights of all the neighboring utterances based on their contributions in predicting the current utterance .
It ensures that the network properly utilizes the local contextual information of an utterance as well as the global contextual information of a video together .
The aim is to compute the interactive attention weights utilizing a softmax activation for each utterance in the video .
Next , we apply a multiplicative gating mechanism following the work of Dhingra et al .
( 2016 )
.
The attentive representation is , then , forwarded to the upper layers for further processing .
We summarize the process ofCAM in Algorithm3 .
3.2 Inter - modal Interactive Module ( IIM ) One of the key objectives of the multi - modal analysis is to fuse the available input modalities effectively .
In general , different modalities represent distinct features despite serving a common goal .
For example , in multi - modal sentiment analysis all the three modalities , i.e. , text , acoustic , andvisual , aim to predict the expressed polarity of an utterance .
The distinctive features in isolation
5651might create an ambiguous scenario for a network to learn effectively .
Therefore , we introduce an auto - encoder based inter - modal interactive module whose objective is to learn the interaction between two distinct modalities to serve a common goal .
The IIM encodes the feature representation of one modality ( say , text ) , and aims to decode it into the feature representation of another modality ( say , acoustic ) .
Similar to an auto - encoder where the input and output are conceptually the same ( or closely related ) , in our case the input and output feature representations of two modalities also intuitively serve a common goal .
After training of IIM , the encoded vector signiﬁes a joint representation of the two modalities , which can be further utilized in the network .
As the proposed architecture in Figure 1 depicts , our proposed model is an end - to - end system , which takes multi - modal raw features for each utterance in a video and predicts an output .
We also train our proposed IIM in the combined framework .
For any pair of modalities , e.g. , text - visual , the encoded vector in IIM receives two gradients of errors , i.e. , one error from the IIM output ( visual)l1and another from the task - speciﬁc label l2 .
We aggregate the errors ( l1+l2 ) at the encoded vector and backpropagate it to the input ( text ) .
Thus , the weights in the encoder part will adjust according to the desired task - speciﬁc label as well .
However , in contrast , the decoder part does not have such information .
Therefore , we employ another IIM to capture the interaction between the visual - text .
This time , the visual features are aware of the desired label during the interaction with textualfeatures .
A conceptual diagram , depicting the gradient ﬂow in IIM for the text and visual modalities , is shown in Figure 2 .

The emotion class happy is approximately 52 % of the total utterances , while emotions fearandsurprise are approximately 8 - 9 % in the dataset .
Further , many utterances have more than one emotions representing the case of multi - label classiﬁcation problem .
The utterances for which all the emotions are absent , we classify them into a no - emotion class .
We depict the statistics of multi - label emotions in Table 2 .
The training , validation and test set distributions are approximately 16 K , 2 K , and 4.6 K , respectively .
4.2 Setups The above datasets offer different dimension of sentiment analysis .
We deﬁne the following setups for our experiments .
Two - class ( posandneg ) classiﬁcation : MOSEI , MOSI , ICT - MMMO , and MOUD .
Three - class ( pos , neu , and neg ) classiﬁcation : YouTube .
Five - class ( strong pos , weak pos , neu , weak neg , and strong neg ) classiﬁcation : MOSEI .
Seven - class ( strong pos , moderate pos , weak pos , neu , weak neg , moderate neg , and strong neg ) classiﬁcation : MOSEI and MOSI .
Intensity prediction : MOSEI and MOSI .
4.3 Experiments We implement our proposed model on the Pythonbased Keras deep learning library .
As the evaluation metric , we employ accuracy ( weighted accu - racy ( Tong et al . , 2017 ) ) and F1 - score for the classiﬁcation problems , while for the intensity prediction task , we compute Pearson correlation scores and mean - absolute - error ( MAE ) .
We evaluate our proposed CIA model on ﬁve benchmark datasets i.e. , MOUD , MOSI , YouTube , ICT - MMMO , and MOSEI .
For all the datasets , we perform grid search to ﬁnd the optimal hyperparameters ( c.f . Table 4 ) .
Though we push for a generic hyper - parameter conﬁguration for all datasets , in some cases , a different choice of the parameter has a signiﬁcant effect .
Therefore , we choose different parameters for different datasets for our experiments .
Details of hyper - parameters for different datasets are depicted in Table 4 .
We use different activation functions for the various modules in our model .
We use tanh as the activation function for the inter - modal interactive module ( IIM ) , while we employ ReLu for the context - aware attention module .
For each dataset , we use Adam as optimizer .
In this paper , we address three multi - modal affective analysis problems , namely i.e. , sentiment classiﬁcation ( SC ) , sentiment intensity ( SI ) and emotion classiﬁcation ( EC ) .
We use softmax as a classiﬁer for sentiment classiﬁcation , while optimizing the categorical cross - entropy as a loss function .
In comparison , we use sigmoid for prediction and binary cross - entropy as the loss function for the emotion classiﬁcation .
As the emotions in the dataset are multi - labeled , we apply a threshold over the predicted sigmoid outputs for each emotion and consider all the emotions as present whose respective values are above the threshold .
We cross - validate and optimize both

We evaluate our proposed approach for all the possible input combinations i.e. , uni - modal ( T , A , V ) , bi - modal ( T+V , T+A , A+V ) and tri - modal ( T+V+A ) .
We depict our obtained results in Table 1 .
For MOSEI dataset , with tri - modal inputs , our proposed system reports 79.02 % F1 - score and 62.97 % weighted - accuracy for emotion classiﬁcation .
For sentiment classiﬁcation , we obtain 78.23 % , 80.37 % , 49.15 % and 50.14 % as F1 - score for two - class , ﬁve - class and seven - class , respectively .
For sentiment intensity prediction task , our proposed system yields MAE and Pearson score of 0.683 and 0.594 , respectively .
We also observe that the proposed approach yields better performance for the tri - modal inputs than the bi - modal and uni - modal input combinations .
This improvement implies that our proposed CIA architecture utilizes the interaction among the input modalities very effectively .
Furthermore , for the other datasets , i.e. , MOSI , ICT - MMMO , YouTube , and MOUD , we also observe a similar phenomenon as well ( c.f . Table 1 ) .
To show that our proposed IIM module , indeed , learns the interaction among the distinct modalities , we also perform an ablation study of the proposed CIA architecture .
Consequently , we omitthe IIM module from our architecture and compute the self - attention on the pair - wise fully - connected representations for the prediction .
We observe that , for all the datasets , the performance of this modiﬁed architecture ( i.e. , CIA - IIM ) is constantly inferior ( with 1 % to 7 % F - score points ) to the proposed CIA architecture .
This performance degradation suggests that the IIM module is , indeed , an important component of our proposed architecture .
In Table 3 , we depict the evaluation results for both- with and without IIM .
4.4 Comparative Analysis In this section , we present our comparative studies against several existing and recent state - ofthe - art systems .
For each dataset , we report three best systems for the comparisons2 .
In particular , we compare with the following systems : Bag of Feature - Multimodal Sentiment Analysis ( BoF - MSA ) ( Blanchard et al . , 2018 ) , Memory Fusion Network ( MFN ) ( Zadeh et
al . , 2018b ) , Deep Fusion - Deep Neural Network ( DF - DNN ) ( Nojavanasghari et al . , 2016 ) , Multi View - LSTM ( MV - LSTM ) ( Rajagopalan et al . , 2016 ) , Early Fusion - LSTM ( EF - LSTM )
( Zadeh et al . , 2018c ) , Tensor Fusion Network ( TFN ) ( Zadeh et al . , 2017 ) , Random Forest ( RF ) ( Breiman , 2001 ) , Support Vector Machine ( Zadeh et al . , 2016 ) , Multi - Attention Recurrent Network ( MARN ) ( Zadeh et al . , 2018a ) , Dynamic Fusion Graph ( DFG ) ( Zadeh et al . , 2018c ) , Multi Modal Multi Utterance - Bimodal Attention ( MMMU - BA ) ( Ghosal et al . , 2018 ) , Bi - directional Contextual LSTM ( BC - LSTM ) ( Poria et al . , 2017b ) and Multimodal Factorization Model ( MFM ) ( Tsai et al . , 2018 ) .
We show the comparative results in Table 5a and Table 5b for emotion and sentiment analysis , respectively .
We observe that the proposed CIA framework yields better performance against the state - of - the - art for all the cases .
For emotion classiﬁcation , our proposed approach achieves approximately 3 and 0.6 percentage higher F12Please note that we report all the results , which are available for comparison

score and weighted accuracy , respectively , than the state - of - the - art DFG ( Zadeh et al . , 2018c ) system .
Furthermore , we also see improvements for most of the individual emotion classes as well .
In sentiment analysis ( c.f . Table 5b ) , for all the ﬁve datasets and different experimental setups , the proposed CIA framework obtains the improved accuracies for the classiﬁcation tasks .
For intensity prediction , our proposed framework yields lesser mean - absolute - error with high Pearson correlation scores .
On average , we observe 1 to 5 % improvement in accuracy values in comparison to the next best systems .
Similarly , for the intensity prediction task , we report approximately 0.03 and 0.04 points improvement in mean - absolute - error and Pearson score , respectively .
We perform statistical signiﬁcance test ( paired T - test ) on the obtained results and observe that performance improvement in the proposed model over the state - of - the - art is signiﬁcant with 95 % conﬁdence ( i.e. , p - value < 0:05 ) .
4.5 Error Analysis We analyze our proposed CIA model to understand the importance of the baseline frameworkCIA - IIM .
We study the predictions of both the models and observe that the proposed CIA framework improves the predictions of the baseline CIA – IIM model .
It indicates that the CIA framework , indeed , learns the interaction among the input modalities , and the model effectively exploits this interaction for better judgment .
In Table 6 , we list the utterances of a CMU - MOSEI video along with their correct and predicted labels for both the proposed and baseline systems .
The video in Table 6 has 4 utterances , out of which the correct sentiments of three utterances ( i.e. , u1,u3 , and u4 ) are positive , while one utterance ( i.e. , u2 ) isnegative .
We observe that our proposed CIA model predicts all the 4 utterances correctly , while the CIA - IIM mis - classify the sentiments of the utterances , u2andu3 .
We also analyze the context - aware attention module ( CAM ) with the help of heatmaps of the attention weights .
The heatmaps , as depicted in Figure 3 , represent the contributing utterances in the neighbourhood for the classiﬁcation of each utterance .
Figures 3a , 3b and 3c show the heatmaps of the pair - wise modality interaction of the proposed model CIA .

the heatmap signiﬁes the weights of utterance ‘ j ’ for the classiﬁcation of utterance ‘ i ’ .
For the utteranceu4 , the model puts more attention weights on theu2andu3of the text - visual interactions , while for the text - acoustic interaction the model assigns higher weights to the u4utterance itself .
Similarly , the model assigns the least weight to the u1utterance , whereas the utterance u3gets the highest weights .
We argue that the proposed CAM module captures the diversity in the input modalities of the contextual utterances for the correct prediction .
For emotion prediction , the CIA model captures all the emotions correctly , while the CIA - IIM framework fails to predict the correct emotions of the utterances , u2andu3 .
For the same video , we also show the attention heatmaps for emotion in Figure 3 .
For the utterance u2 , our proposed model ( CIA ) captures the emotion class ‘ sad ’ as the CAM module assigns higher attention weights on the utterances u2andu3 in Figure 3d , u4 in Figure 3e , and u2 in Figure 3f .
Since the system ﬁnds the contributing neighbours as utterances u2,u3 andu4for various combinations , we argue that it utilizes the information of these utterances - which all express the ‘ sad ’ emotion - for the correct prediction of utterance u2as ‘ sad’.5 Conclusion In this paper , we have proposed a Context - aware Interactive Attention framework that aims to capture the interaction between the input modalities for the multi - modal sentiment and emotion prediction .
We employed a contextual attention module to learn the contributing utterances in the neighborhood by exploiting the interaction among the input modalities .
We evaluate our proposed approach on ﬁve standard multi - modal datasets .
Experiments suggest the effectiveness of the proposed model over various existing systems , for both sentiment and emotion analysis , as we obtained new state - of - the - art for all ﬁve datasets .
In current work , we undertook the problem of sentiment and emotion analysis for a single - party utterances .
In future , we would like to extend our work towards the multi - party dialogue .
