Abstract Court ’s view generation is a novel but essential task for legal AI , aiming at improving the interpretability of judgment prediction results and enabling automatic legal document generation .
While prior text - to - text natural language generation ( NLG ) approaches can be used to address this problem , neglecting the confounding bias from the data generation mechanism can limit the model performance , and the bias may pollute the learning outcomes .
In this paper , we propose a novel Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural Language Generation ( ACNLG ) method , consisting of an attentional encoder and a pair of innovative counterfactual decoders .
The attentional encoder leverages the plaintiff ’s claim and fact description as input to learn a claim - aware encoder from which the claim - related information in fact description can be emphasized .
The counterfactual decoders are employed to eliminate the confounding bias in data and generate judgmentdiscriminative court ’s views ( both supportive and non - supportive views ) by incorporating with a synergistic judgment predictive model .
Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method under both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics .
1 Introduction Owing to the prosperity of machine learning , especially the natural language processing ( NLP ) techniques , many legal assistant systems have been proposed to improve the effectiveness and efﬁciency of a judge from different aspects , such as relevant case retrieval ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) , applicable law articles recommendation ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) , controversy focus mining ( Duan et al . , 2019 ) , and judgment prediction ( Lin et al . , 2012 ; Zhong et al . , 2018 ; Hu et al . , 2018 ; Jiang et al . , 2018 ; Chalkidis et al . , Corresponding Authors .

Court ’s view can be regarded as the interpretation for the sentence of a case .
Being an important portion of verdict , court ’s view is difﬁcult to generate due to its logic reasoning in the content .
Therefore court ’s view generation is regarded as one of the most critical functions in a legal assistant system .
Court ’s view consists of two main parts , including the judgment and the rationales , where the judgment is a response to the plaintiff ’s claims in civil cases or charges in criminal cases , and the rationales are summarized from the fact description to derive and explain the judgment .
Recently , Ye et al .
( 2018 ) investigated the problem of court ’s view generation for the criminal cases , but it focused on the generation of rationales in the court ’s view based on the given criminal charge and fact description of a case .
Such an experimental scenario is not applicable to the practical situation since the rationales should be concluded before reaching the ﬁnal judgment .

Figure 2 : An example of plaintiff ’s claim , fact description , and court ’s view from a legal document in a civil case .
The judgment is non - support since there exists a rejection on one of the plaintiff ’s claims in the court ’s view .
ferent from the criminal cases , in civil cases , the judgment depends not only on the facts recognized but also on the claims that the plaintiff declared .
In this paper , we focus on the problem of automatically generating the court ’s view in civil cases by injecting the plaintiff ’s claim and fact description , as shown in Fig .
2 . In such a context , the problem of the court ’s view generation can be formulated as a text - to - text natural language generation ( NLG ) problem , where the input is the plaintiff ’s claim and the fact description , and the output is the corresponding court ’s view that contains the judgment and the rationales1 .
Although classical text generative models ( e.g. , sequence - tosequence model Sutskever et al . , 2014 , attentionbased model , and pointer - generator networks See et al . , 2017 ) have been applied to many text generation tasks , yet , in the task of the court ’s view generation , such techniques can not be simply applied for the following reasons : ( 1 ) There exists “ no claim , no trial ” principle in civil legal systems : The judgment in the real court ’s view is the response to the claims declared by the plaintiff , where its rationales summarize the corresponding facts .
In other words , there exists a correspondence relationship between the input ( claims and facts ) and the generated text ( court ’s view ) .
For example , the plaintiff ’s claims shown in Fig .
2 mentioned the principal and the interest , respectively .
Hence , the court ’s view of this case would and might only focus on the facts about the principal and the interest .
( 2 ) The imbalance of judgment in civil cases : The distribution of judgment results of civil cases is very imbalanced .
For example , over 76 % of cases were supported in private lending , which is the most frequent category in civil cases .
Such an imbalance of judgment would blind the training 1Since the claims are various , for simpliﬁcation , the judgment of a civil case is deﬁned as supported if all its claims are accepted , otherwise , deﬁned as non-supported.of the model by focusing on the supported cases while ignoring the non - supported cases , leading to incorrect judgment generation of court ’s view .
From the perspective of causality ( Pearl , 2009 ; Kuang et al . , 2020 ) , the imbalance of judgment reveals the confounding bias induced by the data generation mechanism that plaintiffs sue when they have a high probability to be supported .
Such imbalanced data would cause the learned representation of both inputs ( claims and recognized facts ) and output ( court ’s view ) to be supported , leading to confounding bias between inputs and output , and blinding the training process of conventional NLG models as we demonstrated in Fig .
1 . To address these challenges , we propose an Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural Language Generation ( AC - NLG ) method by jointly optimizing a claim - aware encoder , a pair of counterfactual decoders to generate judgmentdiscriminative court ’s views ( both supportive and non - supportive views ) and a synergistic judgment predictive model .
Speciﬁcally , the claim - aware encoder is designed to represent the fact description which emphasizes on the declared claims .
The counterfactual decoder is inspired by the backdoor adjustment in causal inference ( Pearl et al . , 2016 ; Kuang et al . , 2020 ) to address the confounding bias and the imbalance problem in judgment .
To determine the judgment result of each case , a judgment predictive model is jointly learned with the two decoders and decides which output to be selected as the ﬁnal generated court ’s view .
We validate the effectiveness of our AC - NLG method with extensive experiments on real legal documents .
Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method under both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics .
Since legal AI is a sensitive ﬁeld , we make ethical discussion in the penultimate section(Sec . 6 ) .
The main contributions of this paper can be sum-
765marized as follows : We investigate the problem of de - biased court ’s view generation in civil cases from a causal perspective , considering the issue of confounding bias from judgment imbalance .
We propose a novel AC - NLG model to jointly optimize a claim - aware encoder and a pair of counterfactual decoders for generating a judgment - discriminative court ’s view by incorporating with a judgment predictive model .
We construct a dataset based on raw civil legal documents , where each case is objectively split into three parts : plaintiff ’s claim , fact description , and court ’s view with human annotation on the judgment .
To motivate other scholars to investigate this novel but important problem , we make the experiment dataset publicly available2 .
We validate the superior performance of the proposed method with extensive experiments .
Our method can be applied to other natural language generation tasks with confounding bias or data imbalance .
2 Related Work 2.1 Legal Assistant
In recent years , many researchers from both law and computer science ﬁelds have been exploring the potential and methods to perform judicial decisions and auxiliary tasks , aiming at helping lawyers and lower court judges .
In recent work , judicial intelligence is also applied to various tasks of natural language processing .
Since most of the legal documents appear in textual form , many NLP technologies have been brought into the legal ﬁeld to improve the efﬁciency of legal work .
Charge prediction is a common task of judgment prediction , considered as a text classiﬁcation problem ( Lin et al . , 2012 ; Zhong et
al . , 2018 ; Hu et al . , 2018 ; Jiang et al . , 2018 ; Chalkidis et al . , 2019 ) .
Besides , there are also works on legal questions classiﬁcation ( Xiao et al . , 2017 ) , law articles recommendation ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) , controversy focus mining ( Duan et al . , 2019 ) and relevant case retrieval ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) .
Ye et
al .
( 2018 ) explored the court ’s view generation in criminal cases , where the input is only fact description , and the court ’s view generation is conditioned on the known judgment results , which is not applicable in real cases .
2https://github.com/wuyiquan/AC-NLG2.2 Natural Language Generation Our task aims at generating the court ’s view based on the plaintiff ’s claim and the fact description , which can be regarded as a NLG task .
NLG has been widely studied and applied to many tasks , such as machine translation ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) , question answering ( McCann et al . , 2018 ; Bagchi and Wynter , 2013 ) and text summarization ( Rush et al . , 2015 ) .
The recent success of sequence - to - sequence models ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ) , in which recurrent neural networks ( RNNs ) reading and generating text simultaneously , has made the generation task feasible .
Bahdanau et
al .
( 2014 ) ﬁrstly applied the attention mechanism into the NLG task .
See et al .
( 2017 ) proposed a Pointer - Generator Networks ( PGN ) , which can effectively solve the OutOf - V ocabulary ( OOV ) problem .
Although the previous work on NLG can produce ﬂuent sentences , they are struggling to be directly applied to our task since a good court ’s view considers not only the text ﬂuency but also the logical correctness .
2.3 Causal Inference Causal Inference ( Pearl , 2009 ; Kuang et al . , 2020 ) is a powerful statistical modeling tool for explanatory analysis by removing confounding bias in data .
That bias might bring a spurious correlation or confounding effect among variables .
Recently , many methods have been proposed to remove confounding bias in the literature of causal inference , including do - operation based on structure causal model ( Pearl , 2009 ) and counterfactual outcome prediction based on potential outcome framework ( Imbens and Rubin , 2015 ) .
With dooperation , the backdoor adjustment ( Pearl et al . , 2016 ) have been proposed for data de - bias .
In this paper , we sketch the causal structure model of our problem , as shown in Fig .
1 , and adopt backdoor for confounding bias reduction .
3 Problem Formulation In this work , we focus on the problem of the court ’s view generation in civil cases , where the input is the plaintiff ’s claim and the fact description , and the output is the corresponding court ’s view .
We formulate our problem with the deﬁnition of the plaintiff ’s claim , the fact description , and the court ’s view , as shown in Fig .
2 . Plaintiff ’s claim ( C ) is a descriptive sentence that depicts the claims from the plaintiff .
In a civil case , it often appears multiple claims from the

plaintiff .
For example , the plaintiff ’s claim demonstrated in Fig .
2 contains the principal claim and the interest claim .
Here , we denote the plaintiff ’s claim in a case as a sentence form c = fwc tgm t=1 , wherewc trepresents one word , and mis the number of words in plaintiff ’s claim .
Fact description ( F ) is also a descriptive sentence , which describes the identiﬁed facts ( relevant events that have happened ) in a case , as Fig .
2 shows .
Here , we denote the fact description in a case as f = fwf tgn t=1 , wherenis the length .
Court ’s view ( V ) contains two main components , judgment and rationales , where the judgment is to respond the plaintiff ’s claims , and the rationales are the claim - related summarization on the fact description to determine and interpret the judgment .
Here , we denote the court ’s view as v = fwv tgl t=1 , wherelis the length .
Moreover , we use a variable jto denote the judgment in the court ’s view .
For simplicity , we set j= 1to denote supported judgment ( all the claims are judged to be accepted ) , and j= 0to denote non - supported judgment .
Then , the problem of court ’s view generation can be denoted as follow : Problem 1 ( Court ’s View Generation ) .Given
the plaintiff ’s claim c =
fwc tgm t=1and the fact
description f = fwf tgn t=1 , our task is to generate the court ’s view v = fwv tgl t=1 .
4 Method In this section , we ﬁrst introduce the effect of mechanism confounding bias on the court ’s view generation and propose a backdoor - inspired method to eliminate that bias .
Then , we describe our Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural LanguageGeneration ( AC - NLG ) model in detail .
Fig .
3 shows the overall framework .
4.1 Backdoor Adjustment As shown in Fig .
1 , the confounding bias from the data generation mechanism would blind the conventional training on P(VjI ) , and current sequenceto - sequence models struggle to solve this problem .
Here , we see through why these models fail mathematically .
For a certain case , given the input I= ( c;f ) , using Bayes rule , we would train the model to generate the court ’s view Vas follow : P(VjI )
= X jP(VjI;j)P(jjI ) ( 1 ) If the supported cases dominate our training data , e.g. ,P(j= 1jI)1 .
Thus , P(VjI)degrades toP(VjI;j= 1 ) , which would ignore the representation of non - supported cases , leading to the learned representations of inputs Iand outputV tend to be supported .
Thus , the model tends to build a strong connection between inputs and the supported court ’s view , even for the cases that are non - supported .
In this way , the representation of inputIis contaminated by the confounding bias fromI D(J)!V. Backdoor adjustment is a main de - confounding technique in causal inference ( Pearl et al . , 2016 ; Pearl , 2009 ) .
De - confounding seeks the exact causal effect of one variable on another , which appeals for our court ’s view generation task since the court ’s view should be faithful only to the content of the plaintiff ’s claims and fact descriptions .
The backdoor adjustment makes a do - operation onI , which promotes the posterior probability from passive observation to active intervention .
767The backdoor adjustment addresses the confounding bias by computing the interventional posterior P(Vjdo(I))and controlling the confounder as : P(Vjdo(I ) )
= X jP(VjI;j)P(j)(2 ) In our problem , the variable jis a binary variable ( support or non - support ) , hence , P(Vjdo(I ) )
= P(VjI;j= 0)P(j= 0 )
+ P(VjI;j= 1)P(j= 1)(3 )
The main difference between traditional posterior in Eq . 1 and interventional posterior in Eq . 2 is that P(jjI)is changed to P(j ) .
Since the backdooor adjustment help to cut the dependence between D(J)andI , we can eliminate the confounding bias from data generation mechanism and learn a interventional model for de - biased court ’s view generation .
4.2 Backdoor In Implementation As shown in Fig .
3 , to optimize Eq .
3 , we use a pair of counterfactual decoders to learn the likelihood P(VjI;j)for eachj .
At inference , we propose to use a predictor to approximate P(j ) .
Note that our implementation on backdoor - adjustment can be easily applied for multi - valued confounding with multiple counterfactual decoders .
4.3 Model Architecture Our model is conducted in a multi - task learning manner which consists of a shared encoder , a predictor , and a pair of counterfactual decoders .
The predictor and the decoders take the output of the encoder as input .
Our model looks like SHAPED(Zhang et al . , 2018 ) ( several decoders with a classiﬁer ) , but the motivations and mechanisms behind the model are different .
Claim - aware Encoder Intuitively , the plaintiff ’s claimcand the fact description fare sequences of words .
Therefore , the encoder ﬁrstly transforms the words to embeddings .
Then the embedding sequences are fed to the Bi - LSTM , producing two sequences of hidden states hc , hfcorresponding to the plaintiff ’s claim and the fact description respectively .
After that , we use a claim - aware attention mechanism to fuse hcandhf .
For each hidden state hf iinhf , ei kis its attention weight on hc k , and the attention distribution qiis calculated as follow : ei k = vTtanh(Wchc k+Wfhf i+battn ) ( 4)qi = softmax ( ei ) ( 5 ) wherev , Wc , Wf , battnare learnable parameters .
The attention distribution can be regarded as the importance of each word in the plaintiff ’s claim for a word in fact description .
Next , the new representation of fact description is produced as follows : hf i = hf i+X kqi khc k ( 6 ) After feeding to another Bi - LSTM layer , we get the claim - aware representation of fact h. Judgment Predictor Given the claim - aware representation of fact h , the judgment predictor produces the probability of support Psupthrough a fully connected layer and a sigmoid operation .
The prediction result jis obtained as follow : j= ( 1Psup>0:5 0Psup<= 0:5(7 ) where 1 means support , and 0 means non - support .
Counterfactual Decoder To eliminate the effect of data bias , here we use a pair of counterfactual decoders , which contains two decoders , one is for supported cases , and the other is for non - supported cases .
The two decoders have the same structure but aim to generate the court ’s view with different judgments .
We name them as counterfactual decoders because every time there is only one of the two generated court ’s views correct .
Still , we apply the attention - mechanism .
At each step t , given the encoder ’s output h , and the decode state st , the attention distribution atis calculated the same way asqiin Eq . 5 , but with different parameters .
The context vector h tis then a weighted sum of h : h t = X iat ihi ( 8) The context vector h t , which can be regarded as a representation of the input for this step , is concatenated with the decode state stand fed to linear layers to produce the vocabulary distribution pvocab : pvocab = softmax ( V0(V[st;h t ] )
+ b ) + b0)(9 )
whereV , V0,b , b0are all learnable parameters .
Then we add a generation probability ( See et al . , 2017 ) to solve the OOV problem .
Given the context
768h t , the decode state stand the decoder ’s input ( the word embedding of the previous word ) xt , the generation probability pgencan be calculated : Pgen=(wT
hh t+wT
sst+wT xxt+bptr)(10 ) wherewh,ws , wxandbptrare learnable , and is the sigmoid function .
The ﬁnal probability for a wordwin time step is obtained : P(w ) = Pgenpvocab(w ) + ( 1 Pgen)X i : wi = wat i ( 11 ) We introduce how to alienate the two decoders in the training part .
Training For predictor , we use cross - entropy as the loss function : Lpred= ^jlog(Psup) (1 ^j)log(1 Psup ) ( 12 ) where ^jis the real judgment .
For decoders , the previous word in training is the word in real court ’s view , and the loss for timestep tis the negative log - likelihood of the target word w t : Lt= logP(w t ) ( 13 ) and the overall generation loss is : Lgen=1
TTX t=0Lt ( 14 ) where T is the length of real court ’s view .
Since we aim to make the two decoders generate two different court ’s views , we take a mask operation when calculating the loss of each decoder .
The exact loss for the support decoder is : Lsup= ( Lgen^j= 1 0 ^j= 0(15 ) the loss for the non - support decoder Lnsup is obtained by the opposite way .
Thus , the total loss is : Ltotal = Lsup+Lnsup+Lpred ( 16 ) where we set to 0.1 in our model .
Inference In inference , the counterfactual decoders apply beam search to generate two court ’s views , and one of them will be selected as the ﬁnal output , depending on the result of the predictor j. Table 1

Speciﬁcally , we choose private lending , which is the most frequent category in civil cases , to construct the dataset .
We process the legal documents as following steps : 1 ) Split legal documents into three parts : plaintiff ’s claim , facts description , and court ’s view , which can be objectively split by keywords ( subtitles ) .
2 ) Human annotation .
We employ experts with legal backgrounds to annotate the judgment ( deﬁned in Sec . 3 ) on the court ’s view .
3 ) Annotation veriﬁcation .
We use random sampling test to ensure that the annotation accuracy is over 95 % .
After that , we get the dataset as shown in Tab .
1 .
We randomly separate the dataset into a training set , a validation set , and a test set according to a ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 , the ratio of supported cases is about 76 % in each set .
5.2 Baselines We implement the following baselines for comparison : S2SSequence - to - sequence model ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ) is a classic model for NLG task .
We concatenate the plaintiff claims and facts descriptions as input .
PGN Pointer Generator Networks ( See et al . , 2017 ) utilizes a pointer network to solve the outof - vocabulary ( OOV ) problem , which is essential for the court ’s view generation since many nouns occur there .
Oversampling is a common method to alleviate data imbalance .
We oversample the non - supported cases so that the ratio between supported cases and non - supported cases become 1 : 1 . S2SwS Apply oversampling to S2S. 3https://wenshu.court.gov.cn/

To demonstrate that our method is de - biased on judgment generation , we report the result of human evaluation in Tab .
4 . Results of court ’s view generation : From Tab . 2 , we can conclude that : ( 1 ) S2S tends to repeat words , which makes it get high BLEU but low BERT SCORE .
( 2 ) Oversampling strategy does n’t beneﬁt the models , hence , it can not address the confounding bias .
( 3 ) With claim - aware encoder and backdoor - inspired counterfactual decoders , our AC - NLG achieves better performance on court ’s view generation compared with baselines .
( 4 ) The performance gap between AC - NLGw / oCA and AC - NLG demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed claim - aware encoder , and the gap between AC - NLGw / oBA andAC - NLG illustrates the superiority of our counterfactual decoders .
Results of judgment prediction : From Tab . 3 , we have the following observations : ( 1 ) The counterfactual decoders in our model can signiﬁcantly eliminate the confounding bias , hence , achieve remarkable improvement on the non - supported cases , for example boosting f1from 49.8 % to 76.9 % .
( 2 ) The proposed claim - aware encoder has a limited effect on judgment prediction since it ’s designed for improving the quality of generation as shown in Tab .
2 . ( 3 ) Still , oversampling brings no improvement to the model .
Results of human evaluation : From Tab . 4 , we have the following observations : ( 1 ) due to the confounding bias in data , the performance of judgment generation in PGN is poor for non - supported cases , and its performance gap between supported and non - supported cases is huge ( 1.56 ) .
( 2 ) Bydebiasing with backdoor - inspired counterfactual decoders , our AC - NLG signiﬁcantly improves the performance of judgment generation , especially for non - supported cases , and achieves a smaller performance gap ( only 0.28 ) between the supported and non - supported cases .
( 3 ) With a claim - aware encoder , our AC - NLG also achieves better performance on the generation of rational and generated court ’s view ﬂuency .
( 4 ) Kappa coefﬁcient  is more than 0.8 between any two judges , which proves the validation of human evaluation .
Overall , thanks to the proposed claim - aware encoder , counterfactual decoders , and a synergistic judgment predictor , our model achieves better performance than single - task baselines on the task of judgment prediction , judgment generation in court ’s view and court ’s view generation .
5.5 Experiment Details We use Gensim ( ˇReh˚uˇrek and Sojka , 2010 ) with a large - scale generic corpus to train a language model as the pre - trained model , then use it to initialize the word embeddings , which is in the dimension of 300.8 5.6 Case Study Figure 4 shows three court ’s views for a certain case : the court ’s view generated by PGN , by the proposed AC - NLG method , and the real court ’s view .
We ﬁnd that the one generated by PGN accepts the claim for principal , but ignores other claims such as issue related to guarantee .
Compared with the real court ’s view , our model accu8Source code , data , more experiment details and results can be found in supplementary materials .

6 Ethical Discussion While AI is gaining adoption in legal justice(Lin et
al . , 2012 ; Zhong et al . , 2018 ; Hu et al . , 2018 ; Jiang et al . , 2018 ; Chalkidis et al . , 2019 ) , any subtle statistical miscalculation may trigger serious consequences .
From a fairness perspective , prior studies suggested that global ( statistical ) optimization6 = individual ( demographic ) fairness ( Zemel et al . , 2013 ) , and this ethical concern should be further investigated .
In this section , we explore the following ethical issues .
Target User :
According to the report of statistics , a typical active trial judge closed around 250 cases in a year .
Trial judges suffering from ‘ daunting workload ’ is becoming an critical issue(Duan et al . , 2019 ) .
The proposed algorithm is designed for generating the court ’s view draft for assisting the trial judges for decision making .
This work is an algorithmic investigation , but such algorithm should never ‘ replace ’ human judges .
Human knowledge / judgment should be the ﬁnal safeguard to protect social justice and individual fairness .
Potential Error : The potential error would be as follows : a ) generating a wrong judgment and b ) generating a wrong rationale .
The goal of our algorithm is to generate a draft of court ’s view for trail judge as a reference , and judges need to proofread the content generated from algorithm .
Demographic Bias : In this paper , we focus on addressing the bias problem from the data generation by treating the variable of data generation as confounder in back - door adjustment .
The model adoption can face potential demographic bias / unfairness challenges , such as gender and race bias in the training data .
To further ensure the model fairness , in the future , algorithm adoption should be empowered with de - biased legal content pretraining , which could avoid potential demographic bias .
For instance , in order to remove gender / race bias , system could use ( Bolukbasi et al . , 2016 ) algorithm to debias the sensitive gender / race information , e.g. , replace ‘ he / she ’ and ‘ asian / hispanic ’ with gender / race neutral words for pretraining , which can be vital for legal domain .
7 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper , we propose a novel Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural Language Genera - tion ( AC - NLG ) method to solve the task of court ’s view generation in civil cases and ensure the fairness of the judgment .
We design a claim - aware encoder to represent the fact description which emphasizes on the plaintiff ’s claim , as well as a pair of backdoor - inspired counterfactual decoders to generate judgment - discriminative court ’s views ( both supportive and non - supportive views ) and to eliminate the bias that arose from the data generation mechanism by connecting with a synergistic judgment predictive model .
The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method .
Based on the AC - NLG method , in the future , we can explore the following directions : ( 1 ) Improve the accuracy of judgment on a claim - level .
( 2 ) Add external knowledge ( e.g. a logic graph ) to the predictor for the interpretability of the model .
