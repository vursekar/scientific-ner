Learning Input Strictly Local Functions :
Comparing Approaches with Catalan Adjectives Alex Shilen Colin Wilson ashilen1@jhu.edu colin.wilson@jhu.edu Johns Hopkins University 1 Introduction Input strictly local ( ISL ) functions are a class of subregular transductions that have well - understood mathematical and computational properties and that are sufficiently expressive to account for a wide variety of attested morphological and phonological patterns ( e.g. , Chandlee , 2014 ; Chandlee et al . , 2014 ; Chandlee , 2017 ; Chandlee et al . , 2018 ; Chandlee and Heinz , 2018 ) .
In this study , we compared several approaches to learning ISL functions :
the ISL function learning algorithm ( ISLFLA ; Chandlee , 2014 ; Chandlee et al . , 2014 ) and the classic OSTIA learner to which it is related ( Oncina et al . , 1993 ) ; the Minimal Generalization Learner ( MGL ; Albright and Hayes , 2002 , 2003 ) ; and a novel deep neural network model presented here ( DNN - ISL ) .
The four models were evaluated on their ability to learn the mapping from feminine singular ( fem.sg . )
to masculine singular ( masc.sg . )
surface forms of Catalan adjectives ( and , separately , from provided underlying representations to fem.sg .
andmasc.sg .
surface forms ) .
The mappings to masc.sg .
forms in Catalan involve several phonological modifications at the right edge of the word ( e.g. , Mascaró , 1976 ) , the empirical focus of our study .
The relevant processes include obstruent devoicing and strengthening ( e.g. , [ rOZ@ ] fem.sg .
→ [ rOtS ] masc.sg .
‘ red ’ ) , post - tonic n - Deletion ( e.g. , [ san@]→[sa]‘healthy ’ ) , and cluster simplification ( e.g. , [ blaNk@ ] →[blaN ] ‘ white ’ ) .
There are opaque , counterfeeding interactions among some of the processes ( e.g. , [ f@kund@ ] →[f@kun ] / *
[ f@ku ] ‘ fertile ’ ) , consistent with the idea that the mappings are input- rather than output- determined ( see Chandlee et al . , 2018 ) .
A small number of apparent lexical exceptions to the typical modification pattern ( e.g. , [ blan@]→[blan ] / *
[ bla ] ‘ soft ’ ) are problematic for ISL learners that assume perfect homogeneity .
Our main findings were that the DNN - ISL learner achieved high accuracy on the Catalan data , with MGL coming in a close second , while ISLFLA and OSTIA performed much worse — either failing to learn any mapping at all or predicting the correct output for less than 5 % of held - out cases , even when lexical exceptions were removed from the data ( see Table 1 ) .
2 Data The FestCat project ( Bonafonte et al . , 2008 ) provides broad transcriptions for more than 53,000 adjectival surface forms in two major dialects of Catalan .
We considered the Central Catalan forms and restricted our data to the nearly 6,500 lemmas that are also attested in a subtitle lexicon ( Boada et al . , 2020 ) .
While our main focus was on learning , we also developed a hand - written ISL transducer for the mapping to masc.sg .
forms that is highly accurate ( > 98 % correct ) , along with custom code to derive plausible underlying representations from masc.sg .

pairs .
3 Models For the purposes of this abstract , we assume familiarity with ISLFLA , OSTIA , and MGL .
We verified that the implementation of MGL learns only ISL phonological rules — rules conditioned on local phonological context in the result of a morphological operation such as affixation or truncation — a connection that has not previously been made in the literature .
The deep neural network model proposed here ( DNN - ISL ) also applies morphological operations followed by phonological modifications , the latter being implemented with weighted constraints rather than rules .
A phonological constraint as learned by DNN - ISL is defined by : a three - segment featural pattern specifying the input context to which the constraint applies ; a preference for one type of modification applied to the center segment of the context ( i.e. , deletion , epenthesis before / after , or feature change ) ; target output features in the case244 Proceedings of the Society for Computation in Linguistics ( SCiL ) 2022 , pages 244 - 246 .

ISLFLA failed to learn a transducer in each run , as indicated by ‘ — ’ , returning “ Insufficient data ” ( see Chandlee 2014:117 ) .
The Baseline model simply subtracted the feminine suffix -@. * OSTIA and ISLFLA performed better when input and output forms were trimmed to their final VC∗(V ) sequences , as shown after the slash , but ISLFLA still failed to learn a transducer in 4/10 of the runs on the full data set .
SDs were lower than .04 in most cells .
Perfect performance on the training data , shown here for OSTIA only , is available to any model with sufficient memory .
of epenthesis or change ; and a real - valued strength .
Each constraint computes the degree to which its context matches every three - segment window in the input ( i.e. , it applies a novel feature based convolution operation to the input ) and imposes its preferred modification in proportion to the degree of match and its strength .
These preferences are summed over constraints for each input position and applied to the positions independently to derive the phonological output .
The parameters of the constraints are straightforwardly interpretable and visualizable as real - valued phonological feature coefficients , modification - type logits , and strengths .
The model is fully differentiable and was trained with the Adagrad optimizer on small mini - batches for 20 epochs .
4 Results We evaluated all four models on the same training / validation / testing data , as summarized in Table 1 .
ISLFLA and OSTIA were unable to learn accurate mappings except when the fem.sg .
and masc.sg .
forms were artificially trimmed to their final VC ∗(V ) sequences — a strong , languagespecific bias to attend to changes at the end of the word that the other models did not require .
Results for larger training splits , and for mapping from URs to SRs , were similar .
The errors made by DNN - ISL mostly involved underapplication of deletion ( e.g. , *
[ blaNk ] ) .
5 Contributions & future directions In summary , we evaluated four learning models on an ISL phonological mapping ( with a small number of exceptions ) found in a large , realistic body of natural language data .
The models that have proofsof learnability and efficiency , ISLFLA and OSTIA , performed much worse than models that currently lack such theoretical guarantees but share the inductive bias for ISL patterns .
The results highlight the need for further empirical and formal study of highperforming subsymbolic models such as DNN - ISL , and extension of our model to output - based patterns and learning of underlying representations .
We plan to release our processed data , hand - written ISL transducer , and model implementations .
