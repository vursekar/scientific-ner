Abstract We introduce PubMedQA , a novel biomedical question answering ( QA ) dataset collected from PubMed abstracts .
The task of PubMedQA is to answer research questions with yes / no / maybe ( e.g. : Do preoperative statins reduce atrial ﬁbrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting ? )
using the corresponding abstracts .
PubMedQA has 1k expert - annotated , 61.2k unlabeled and 211.3k artiﬁcially generated QA instances .
Each PubMedQA instance is composed of ( 1 ) a question which is either an existing research article title or derived from one , ( 2 ) a context which is the corresponding abstract without its conclusion , ( 3 ) a long answer , which is the conclusion of the abstract and , presumably , answers the research question , and ( 4 ) a yes / no / maybe answer which summarizes the conclusion .
PubMedQA is the ﬁrst QA dataset where reasoning over biomedical research texts , especially their quantitative contents , is required to answer the questions .
Our best performing model , multi - phase ﬁne - tuning of BioBERT with long answer bag - of - word statistics as additional supervision , achieves 68.1 % accuracy , compared to single human performance of 78.0 % accuracy and majority - baseline of 55.2 % accuracy , leaving much room for improvement .
PubMedQA is publicly available athttps://pubmedqa.github.io .
1 Introduction A long - term goal of natural language understanding is to build intelligent systems that can reason and infer over natural language .
The question answering ( QA ) task , in which models learn how to answer questions , is often used as a benchmark for quantitatively measuring the reasoning and inferring abilities of such intelligent systems .
While many large - scale annotated general domain QA datasets have been introduced ( Rajpurkar et al . , 2016 ; Lai et al . , 2017 ; Ko ˇcisk`yQues tion : Do preoperative statins reduce atrial ﬁbrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting ?
Context : ( Objective ) Recent studies have demonstrated that statins have pleiotropic effects , including anti - inﬂammatory effects and atrial ﬁbrillation ( AF ) preventive effects [ ... ] ( Methods ) 221 patients underwent CABG in our hospital from 2004 to 2007 .
14 patients with preoperative AF and 4 patients with concomitant valve surgery [ ... ] ( Results ) The overall incidence of postoperative AF was 26 % .
Postoperative AF was signiﬁcantly lower in the Statin group compared with the Non - statin group ( 16 % versus 33 % , p=0.005 ) .
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent predictors of AF
[ ... ] Long Answer : ( Conclusion ) Our study indicated that preoperative statin therapy seems to reduce AF development after CABG .
Answer : yes Figure 1 : An instance ( Sakamoto et al . , 2011 ) of PubMedQA dataset :
Question is the original question title ; Context includes the structured abstract except its conclusive part , which serves as the Long Answer ; Human experts annotated the Answer yes .
Supporting fact for the answer is highlighted .
et
al . , 2018 ; Yang et al . , 2018 ; Kwiatkowski et al . , 2019 ) , the largest annotated biomedical QA dataset , BioASQ ( Tsatsaronis et al . , 2015 ) has less than 3k training instances , most of which are simple factual questions .
Some works proposed automatically constructed biomedical QA datasets ( Pampari et al . , 2018 ; Pappas et al . , 2018 ; Kim et al . , 2018 ) , which have much larger sizes .
However , questions of these datasets are mostly factoid , whose answers can be extracted in the contexts without much reasoning .
In this paper , we aim at building a biomedical QA dataset which ( 1 ) has substantial instances with some expert annotations and ( 2 ) requires reasoning over the contexts to answer the questions .
For this , we turn to the PubMed1 , a search engine providing access to over 25 million references of 1https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
2568biomedical articles .
We found that around 760k articles in PubMed use questions as their titles .
Among them , the abstracts of about 120k articles are written in a structured style – meaning they have subsections of “ Introduction ” , “ Results ” etc .
Conclusive parts of the abstracts , often in “ Conclusions ” , are the authors ’ answers to the question title .
Other abstract parts can be viewed as the contexts for giving such answers .
This pattern perfectly ﬁts the scheme of QA , but modeling it as abstractive QA , where models learn to generate the conclusions , will result in an extremely hard task due to the variability of writing styles .
Interestingly , more than half of the question titles of PubMed articles can be brieﬂy answered by yes / no / maybe , which is signiﬁcantly higher than the proportions of such questions in other datasets , e.g. : just 1 % in Natural Questions ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 2019 ) and 6 % in HotpotQA ( Yang et al . , 2018 ) .
Instead of using conclusions to answer the questions , we explore answering them with yes / no / maybe and treat the conclusions as a long answer for additional supervision .
To this end , we present PubMedQA , a biomedical QA dataset for answering research questions using yes / no / maybe .
We collected all PubMed articles with question titles , and manually labeled 1k of them for cross - validation and testing .
An example is shown in Fig .
1 . The rest of yes / no / answerable QA instances compose of the unlabeled subset which can be used for semisupervised learning .
Further , we automatically convert statement titles of 211.3k
PubMed articles to questions and label them with yes / no answers using a simple heuristic .
These artiﬁcially generated instances can be used for pre - training .
Unlike other QA datasets in which questions are asked by crowd - workers for existing contexts ( Rajpurkar et al . , 2016 ; Yang et al . , 2018 ; Ko ˇcisk`y et al . , 2018 ) , in PubMedQA contexts are generated to answer the questions and both are written by the same authors .
This consistency assures that contexts are perfectly related to the questions , thus making PubMedQA an ideal benchmark for testing scientiﬁc reasoning abilities .
As an attempt to solve PubMedQA and provide a strong baseline , we ﬁne - tune BioBERT ( Lee et al . , 2019 ) on different subsets in a multi - phase style with additional supervision of long answers .
Though this model generates decent results and vastly outperforms other baselines , it ’s still muchworse than the single - human performance , leaving signiﬁcant room for future improvements .
2 Related Works Biomedical QA : Expert - annotated biomedical QA datasets are limited by scale due to the difﬁculty of annotations .
In 2006 and 2007 , TREC2 held QA challenges on genomics corpus ( Hersh et al . , 2006 , 2007 ) , where the task is to retrieve relevant documents for 36 and 38 topic questions , respectively .
QA4MRE ( Pe ˜nas et al . , 2013 ) included a QA task about Alzheimer ’s disease ( Morante et al . , 2012 ) .
This dataset has 40 QA instances and the task is to answer a question related to a given document using one of ﬁve answer choices .
The QA task of BioASQ ( Tsatsaronis et al . , 2015 ) has phases of ( a ) retrieve question - related documents and ( b ) using related documents as contexts to answer yes / no , factoid , list or summary questions .
BioASQ 2019 has a training set of 2,747 QA instances and a test set of 500 instances .
Several large - scale automatically collected biomedical QA datasets have been introduced : emrQA ( Pampari et al . , 2018 ) is an extractive QA dataset for electronic medical records ( EHR ) built by re - purposing existing annotations on EHR corpora .
BioRead ( Pappas et al . , 2018 ) and BMKC ( Kim et al . , 2018 ) both collect cloze - style QA instances by masking biomedical named entities in sentences of research articles and using other parts of the same article as context .
Yes / No QA : Datasets such as HotpotQA ( Yang et al . , 2018 ) , Natural Questions ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 2019 ) , ShARC ( Saeidi et al . , 2018 ) and BioASQ ( Tsatsaronis et al . , 2015 ) contain yes / no questions as well as other types of questions .
BoolQ ( Clark et al . , 2019 ) speciﬁcally focuses on naturally occurring yes / no questions , and those questions are shown to be surprisingly difﬁcult to answer .
We add a “ maybe ” choice in PubMedQA to cover uncertain instances .
Typical neural approaches to answering yes / no questions involve encoding both the question and context , and decoding the encoding to a class output , which is similar to the well - studied natural language inference ( NLI ) task .
Recent breakthroughs of pre - trained language models like ELMo ( Peters et al . , 2018 ) and BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) show signiﬁcant performance im2https://trec.nist.gov/

3 PubMedQA Dataset 3.1 Data Collection PubMedQA is split into three subsets : labeled , unlabeled and artiﬁcially generated .
They are denoted as PQA - L(abeled ) , PQA - U(nlabeled ) and PQA - A(rtiﬁcial ) , respectively .
We show the architecture of PubMedQA dataset in Fig .

Collection of PQA - L and PQA - U : PubMed articles which have i ) a question mark in the titles and ii ) a structured abstract with conclusive part are collected and denoted as pre - PQA - U.
Now each instance has 1 ) a question which is the original title 2 ) a context which is the structured abstract without the conclusive part and 3 ) a long answer which is the conclusive part of the abstract .
Two annotators3labeled 1k instances from prePQA - U with yes / no / maybe to build PQA - L using Algorithm 1 .
The annotator 1 does n’t need to do much reasoning to annotate since the long answer is available .
We denote this reasoning - free setting .
However , the annotator 2 can not use the long answer , so reasoning over the context is required for 3Both are qualiﬁed M.D. candidates .

We denote such setting as reasoningrequired setting .
Note that the annotation process might assign wrong labels when both annotator 1 and annotator 2 make a same mistake , but considering human performance in x5.1 , such error rate could be as low as 1%4 . 500 randomly sampled PQA - L instances are used for 10 - fold cross validation and the rest 500 instances consist of PubMedQA test set .
Further , we include the unlabeled instances in pre - PQA - U with yes / no / maybe answerable questions to build PQA - U. For this , we use a simple rule - based method which removes all questions started with interrogative words ( i.e. wh - words ) or involving selections from multiple entities .
This results in over 93 % agreement with annotator 1 in identifying the questions that can be answered by yes / no / maybe .
Collection of PQA - A : Motivated by the recent successes of large - scale pre - training from ELMo ( Peters et al . , 2018 ) and BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) , we use a simple heuristic to collect many noisily - labeled instances to build PQA - A for pretraining .
Towards this end , we use PubMed articles with 1 ) a statement title which has POS tagging structures of NP-(VBP / VBZ)5and 2 ) a structured abstract including a conclusive part .

statement titles are converted to questions by simply moving or adding copulas ( “ is ” , “ are ” ) or auxiliary verbs ( “ does ” , “ do ” ) in the front and further revising for coherence ( e.g. : adding a question mark ) .
We generate the yes / no answer according to negation status of the VB .
Several examples are shown in Table 2 .
We collected 211.3k instances for PQA - A , of which 200k randomly sampled instances are for training and the rest 11.3k instances are for validation .
3.2 Characteristics We show the basic statistics of three PubMedQA subsets in Table 1 .
Instance Topics : PubMed abstracts are manually annotated by medical librarians with Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH)6 , which is a controlled vocabulary designed to describe the topics of biomedical texts .
We use MeSH terms to represent abstract topics , and visualize their distribution in Fig .
3 .
Nearly all instances are human studies and they cover a wide variety of topics , including retrospective , prospective , and cohort studies , different age groups , and healthcare - related subjects like treatment outcome , prognosis and risk factors of diseases .

Question and Reasoning Types : We sampled 200 examples from PQA - L and analyzed the types of questions and types of reasoning required to answer them , which is summarized in Table 3 .
Various types of questions have been asked , including causal effects , evaluations of therapies , relatedness , and whether a statement is true .
Besides , PubMedQA also covers several different reasoning types : most ( 57.5 % ) involve comparing multiple groups ( e.g. : experiment and control ) , and others require interpreting statistics of a single group or its subgroups .
Reasoning over quantitative contents is required in nearly all ( 96.5 % ) of them , which is expected due to the nature of biomedical research .
75.5 % of contexts have text descriptions of the statistics while 21.0 % only have the numbers .
We use a Sankey diagram to show the proportional relationships between corresponded question type and reasoning type , as well as corresponded reasoning type and whether there are text interpretations of numbers in Fig .
4 . 3.3 Evaluation Settings The main metrics of PubMedQA are accuracy and macro - F1 on PQA - L test set using question and context as input .
We denote prediction using question and context as a reasoning - required setting , because under this setting answers are not directly

expressed in the input and reasoning over the contexts is required to answer the question .
Additionally , long answers are available at training time , so generation or prediction of them can be used as an auxiliary task in this setting .
A parallel setting , where models can use question and long answer to predict yes / no / maybe answer , is denoted as reasoning - free setting since yes /
no / maybe are usually explicitly expressed in the long answers ( i.e. : conclusions of the abstracts ) .
Obviously , it ’s a much easier setting which can be exploited for bootstrapping PQA - U. 4 Methods 4.1 Fine - tuning BioBERT We ﬁne - tune BioBERT ( Lee et al . , 2019 ) on PubMedQA as a baseline .
BioBERT is initialized with BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) and further pretrained on PubMed abstracts and PMC7articles .
Expectedly , it vastly outperforms BERT in various biomedical NLP tasks .
We denote the original transformer weights of BioBERT as 0 .
While ﬁne - tuning , we feed PubMedQA questions and contexts ( or long answers ) , separated 7https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/by the special [ SEP ] token , to BioBERT .
The yes / no / maybe labels are predicted using the special[CLS ] embedding using a softmax function .
Cross - entropy loss of predicted and true label distribution is denoted as LQA .
4.2 Long Answer as Additional Supervision Under reasoning - required setting , long answers are available in training but not inference phase .
We use them as an additional signal for training : similar to Ma et al .
( 2018 ) regularizing neural machine translation models with binary bag - of - word ( BoW ) statistics , we ﬁne - tune BioBERT with an auxiliary task of predicting the binary BoW statistics of the long answers , also using the special [ CLS ] embedding .
We minimize binary crossentropy loss of this auxiliary task : LBoW= 1 NX ibilog^bi+ ( 1 bi)log(1 ^bi ) wherebiand^biare ground - truth and predicted probability of whether token iis in the long answers ( i.e.:bi2f0;1gand^bi2[0;1 ] ) , andNis the BoW vocabulary size .
The total loss is : L = LQA+  LBoW
2572 Figure 5 : Multi - phase ﬁne - tuning architecture .
Notations and equations are described in x4.3 .
In reasoning - free setting which we use for bootstrapping , the regularization coefﬁcient  is set to 0 because long answers are directly used as input .
4.3 Multi - phase Fine - tuning Schedule Since PQA - A and PQA - U have different properties from the ultimate test set of PQA - L , BioBERT is ﬁne - tuned in a multi - phase style on different subsets .
Fig .
5 shows the architecture of this training schedule .
We use q , c , a , lto denote question , context , long answer and yes / no / maybe label of instances , respectively .
Their source subsets are indexed by the superscripts of A for PQA - A , U for PQA - U and L for PQA - L. Phase I Fine - tuning on PQA - A : PQA - A is automatically collected whose questions and labels are artiﬁcially generated .
As a result , questions of PQA - A might differ a lot from those of PQAU and PQA - L , and it only has yes / no labels with a very imbalanced distribution ( 92.8 % yes v.s. 7.2 % no ) .
Despite these drawbacks , PQA - A has substantial training instances so models could still beneﬁt from it as a pre - training step .
Thus , in Phase I of multi - phase ﬁne - tuning , we initialize BioBERT with 0 , and ﬁne - tune it on PQA - A using question and context as input : I argminL(BioBERT (qA;cA);lA)(1 )
Phase II Fine - tuning on Bootstrapped PQA - U : To fully utilize the unlabeled instances in PQA - U , we exploit the easiness of reasoning - free setting to pseudo - label these instances with a bootstrapping strategy : ﬁrst , we initialize BioBERT with 0 , and ﬁne - tune it on PQA - A using question and long answer ( reasoning - free ) , B1 argminL(BioBERT (qA;aA);lA)(2)then
we further ﬁne - tune BioBERT B1on PQAL , also under the reasoning - free setting : B2 argminL(BioBERT (qL;aL);lL)(3 ) We pseudo - label PQA - U instances using the most conﬁdent predictions of BioBERT B2for each class .
Conﬁdence is simply deﬁned by the corresponding softmax probability and then we label a subset which has the same proportions of yes / no / maybe labels as those in the PQA - L : lU pseudo BioBERT B2(qU;aU ) ( 4 ) In phase II , we ﬁne - tune BioBERT Ion the bootstrapped PQA - U using question and context ( under reasoning - required setting ): II argminL(BioBERT (qU;cU);lU pseudo ) ( 5 ) Final Phase Fine - tuning on PQA - L : In the ﬁnal phase , we ﬁne - tune BioBERT IIon PQA - L : F argminL(BioBERT (qL;cL);lL)(6 )
Final predictions on instances of PQA - L validation and test sets are made using BioBERT F : lpred = BioBERT F(qL;cL ) 4.4
Compared Models Majority : The majority ( about 55 % ) of the instances have the label “ yes ” .
We use a trivial baseline denoted as Majority where we simply predict “ yes ” for all instances , regardless of the question and context .
Shallow Features :
For each instance , we include the following shallow features : 1 ) TF - IDF statistics of the question 2 ) TF - IDF statistics of the context / long answer and 3 ) sum of IDF of the overlapping non - stop words between the question and the context / long answer .
To allow multi - phase ﬁne - tuning , we apply a feed - forward neural network on the shallow features instead of using a logistic classiﬁer .
BiLSTM : We simply concatenate the question and context / long answer with learnable segment embeddings appended to the biomedical word2vec embeddings ( Pyysalo et al . , 2013 ) of each token .
The concatenated sentence is then fed to a biLSTM , and the ﬁnal hidden states of the forward and backward network are used for classifying the yes / no / maybe label .
2573ESIM with BioELMo : Following the state - ofthe - art recurrent architecture of NLI ( Peters et al . , 2018 ) , we use pre - trained biomedical contextualized embeddings BioELMo ( Jin et al . , 2019 ) for word representations .
Then we apply the ESIM model ( Chen et al . , 2016 ) , where a biLSTM is used to encode the question and context / long answer , followed by an attentional local inference layer and a biLSTM inference composition layer .
After pooling , a softmax output unit is applied for predicting the yes / no / maybe label .
4.5 Compared Training Schedules Final Phase Only : Under this setting , we train models only on PQA - L.
It ’s an extremely low resources setting where there are only 450 training instances in each fold of cross - validation .
Phase I + Final Phase : Under this setting , we skip the training on bootstrapped PQA - U. Models are ﬁrst ﬁne - tuned on PQA - A , and then ﬁne - tuned on PQA - L. Phase II + Final Phase : Under this setting , we skip the training on PQA - A. Models are ﬁrst ﬁne - tuned on bootstrapped PQA - U , and then ﬁnetuned on PQA - L. Single - phase Training : Instead of training a model sequentially on different splits , under single - phase training setting we train the model on the combined training set of all PQA splits : PQAA , bootstrapped PQA - U and PQA - L. 5 Experiments 5.1 Human Performance Human performance is measured during the annotation : As shown in Algorithm 1 , annotations of annotator 1 and annotator 2 are used to calculate reasoning - free and reasoning - required human performance , respectively , against the discussed ground truth labels .
Human performance on the test set of PQA - L is shown in Table 4 .
We only test single - annotator performance due to limited resources .
Kwiatkowski et al .
( 2019 ) show that an ensemble of annotators perform signiﬁcantly better than single - annotator , so the results reported in Table 4 are the lower bounds of human performance .
Under reasoning - free setting where the annotator can see the conclusions , a single human achieves 90.4 % accuracy and 84.2 % macroF1 .
Under reasoning - required setting , the task be - comes much harder , but it ’s still possible for humans to solve : a single annotator can get 78.0 % accuracy and 72.2 % macro - F1 .
Setting Accuracy ( % ) Macro - F1 ( % ) Reasoning - Free 90.40 84.18 Reasoning - Required 78.00 72.19 Table 4 : Human performance ( single - annotator ) .
5.2 Main Results We report the test set performance of different models and training schedules in Table 5 .
In general , multi - phase ﬁne - tuning of BioBERT with additional supervision outperforms other baselines by large margins , but the results are still much worse than just single - human performance .
Comparison of Models : A trend of BioBERT > ESIM w/ BioELMo > BiLSTM > shallow features > majority , conserves across different training schedules on both accuracy and macro - F1 .
Fine - tuned BioBERT is better than state - of - theart recurrent model of ESIM w/ BioELMo , probably because BioELMo weights are ﬁxed while all BioBERT parameters can be ﬁne - tuned , which better beneﬁt from the pre - training settings .
Comparison of Training Schedules : Multiphase ﬁne - tuning setting gets 5 out of 9 modelwise best accuracy / macro - F1 .
Due to lack of annotated data , training only on the PQA - L ( ﬁnal phase only ) generates similar results as the majority baseline .
In phase I + Final setting where models are pre - trained on PQA - A , we observe signiﬁcant improvements on accuracy and macro - F1 and some models even achieve their best accuracy under this setting .
This indicates that a hard task with limited training instances can be at least partially solved by pre - training on a large automatically collected dataset when the tasks are similarly formatted .
Improvements are also observed in phase II + Final setting , though less signiﬁcant than those of phase I + Final .
As expected , multi - phase ﬁnetuning schedule is better than single - phase , due to different properties of the subsets .
Additional Supervision : Despite its simplicity , the auxiliary task of long answer BoW prediction clearly improves the performance : most results ( 28/40 ) are better with such additional supervision than without .

5.3 Intermediate Results
In this section we show the intermediate results of multi - phase ﬁne - tuning schedule .
Phase I : Results are shown in Table 6 .
Phase I is ﬁne - tuning on PQA - A using question and context .
Since PQA - A is imbalanced due to its collection process , a trivial majority baseline gets 92.76 % accuracy .
Other models have better accuracy and especially macro - F1 than majority baseline .
Finetuned BioBERT performs best .

Experiments are on pseudo - labeled PQA - U under reasoning - required setting .
A.S. : additional supervision .
Bootstrapping : Results are shown in Table 7 .
Bootstrapping is a three - step process : ﬁne - tuning on PQA - A , then on PQA - L and pseudo - labeling PQA - U. All three steps are using question and long answer as input .
Expectedly , models perform better in this reasoning - free setting than they do in reasoning - required setting ( for PQA - A , Eq . 2 results in Table 7 are better than the performance in Table 6 ; for PQA - L , Eq . 3 results in Table 7 are better than the performance in Table 5 ) .
Phase II : Results are shown in Table 8 .
In Phase II , since each model is ﬁne - tuned on its own pseudo - labeled PQA - U instances , results are not comparable between models .
While the ablation study in Table 5 clearly shows that Phase II is helpful , performance in Phase II does n’t necessarily correlate with ﬁnal performance on PQA - L.
25756 Conclusion We present PubMedQA , a novel dataset aimed at biomedical research question answering using yes / no / maybe , where complex quantitative reasoning is required to solve the task .
PubMedQA has substantial automatically collected instances as well as the largest size of expert annotated
yes / no / maybe questions in biomedical domain .
We provide a strong baseline using multi - phase ﬁne - tuning of BioBERT with long answer as additional supervision , but it ’s still much worse than just single human performance .
There are several interesting future directions to explore on PubMedQA , e.g. : ( 1 ) about 21 % of PubMedQA contexts contain no natural language descriptions of numbers , so how to properly handle these numbers is worth studying ; ( 2 ) we use binary BoW statistics prediction as a simple demonstration for additional supervision of long answers .
Learning a harder but more informative auxiliary task of long answer generation might lead to further improvements .
Articles of PubMedQA are biased towards clinical study - related topics ( described in Appendix B ) , so PubMedQA has the potential to assist evidence - based medicine , which seeks to make clinical decisions based on evidence of high quality clinical studies .
Generally , PubMedQA can serve as a benchmark for testing scientiﬁc reasoning abilities of machine reading comprehension models .

Hotpotqa : A dataset for diverse , explainable multi - hop question answering .
arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.09600 .
2577A Yes / no / maybe Answerability Not all naturally occuring question titles from PubMed are answerable by yes / no / maybe .
The ﬁrst step of annotating PQA - L ( as shown in algorithm 1 ) from pre - PQA - U is to manually identify questions that can be answered using yes / no / maybe .
We labeled 1091 ( about 50.2 % ) of 2173 question titles as unanswerable .
For example , those questions can not be answered by yes / no / maybe : “Critical Overview of HER2 Assessement in Bladder Cancer : What Is Missing for a Better Therapeutic Approach ? ”
( wh- question )
“Otolaryngology externships and the match : Productive or futile ? ” ( multiple choices ) B Over - represented Topics Clinical study - related topics are over - represented in PubMedQA : we found proportions of MeSH terms like : “Pregnancy Outcome ” “Socioeconomic Factors ” “Risk Assessment ” “Survival Analysis ” “Prospective Studies ” “Case - Control Studies ” “Reference Values ” are signiﬁcantly higher in the PubMedQA articles than those in 200k most recent general PubMed articles ( signiﬁcance is deﬁned by p<0:05 in twoproportion z - test ) .
C Annotation Criteria Strictly speaking , most yes / no / maybe research questions can be answered by “ maybe ” since there will always be some conditions where one statement is true and vice versa .
However , the task will be trivial in this case .
Instead , we annotate a question using “ yes ” if the experiments and results in the paper indicate it , so the answer is not universal but context - dependent .
Given a question like “ Do patients beneﬁt from drug X ? ” : certainly not all patients will beneﬁt from it , but if there is a signiﬁcant difference inan outcome between the experimental and control group , the answer will be “ yes ” .
If there is not , the answer will be “ no ” .
“ Maybe ” is annotated when ( 1 ) the paper discusses conditions where the answer is True and conditions where the answer is False or ( 2 ) more than one intervention / observation / etc . is asked , and the answer is True for some but False for the others ( e.g. : “ Do Disease A , Disease B and/or Disease C beneﬁt from drug X ? ” ) .
To model uncertainty of the answer , we do n’t strictly follow the logic calculations where such questions can always be answered by either “ yes ” or “ no ” .
