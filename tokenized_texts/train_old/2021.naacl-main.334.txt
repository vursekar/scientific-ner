This is of paramount importance for entity - level tasks such as entity linking where the ability to model entity relations ( especially synonymy ) is pivotal .
To address this challenge , we propose S APBERT , a pretraining scheme that selfaligns the representation space of biomedical entities .
We design a scalable metric learning framework that can leverage UMLS , a massive collection of biomedical ontologies with 4M+ concepts .
In contrast with previous pipelinebased hybrid systems , S APBERT offers an elegant one - model - for - all solution to the problem of medical entity linking ( MEL ) , achieving a new state - of - the - art ( SOTA ) on six MEL benchmarking datasets .
In the scientiﬁc domain , we achieve SOTA even without taskspeciﬁc supervision .
With substantial improvement over various domain - speciﬁc pretrained MLMs such as B IOBERT , SCIBERTand P UBMEDBERT , our pretraining scheme proves to be both effective and robust.1 1
Introduction Biomedical entity2representation is the foundation for a plethora of text mining systems in the medical domain , facilitating applications such as literature search ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) , clinical decision making ( Roberts et al . , 2015 ) and relational knowledge discovery ( e.g. chemical - disease , drug - drug and protein - protein relations , Wang et al . 2018 ) .
The heterogeneous naming of biomedical concepts Work conducted prior to joining Amazon .

2In this work , biomedical entity refers to the surface forms of biomedical concepts , which can be a single word ( e.g. fever ) , a compound ( e.g. sars - cov-2 ) or a short phrase ( e.g. abnormal retinal vascular development ) .
PUBMEDBERT+ SAPBERTPUBMEDBERT Figure 1 : The t - SNE ( Maaten and Hinton , 2008 ) visualisation of UMLS entities under P UBMEDBERT ( BERT pretrained on PubMed papers ) & P UBMEDBERT+SAPBERT ( PUBMEDBERT further pretrained on UMLS synonyms ) .
The biomedical names of different concepts are hard to separate in the heterogeneous embedding space ( left ) .
After the self - alignment pretraining , the same concept ’s entity names are drawn closer to form compact clusters ( right ) .
poses a major challenge to representation learning .
For instance , the medication Hydroxychloroquine is often referred to as Oxichlorochine ( alternative name ) , HCQ ( in social media ) and Plaquenil ( brand name ) .
MEL addresses this problem by framing it as a task of mapping entity mentions to uniﬁed concepts in a medical knowledge graph.3The main bottleneck of MEL is the quality of the entity representations ( Basaldella et al . , 2020 ) .
Prior works in this domain have adopted very sophisticated text pre - processing heuristics ( D’Souza and Ng , 2015 ;
Kim et al . , 2019 ; Ji et al . , 2020 ; Sung et al . , 2020 ) which can hardly cover all the variations of biomedical names .
In parallel , self - supervised learning has shown tremendous success in NLP via leveraging the masked language modelling ( MLM ) 3Note that we consider only the biomedical entities themselves and not their contexts , also known as medical concept normalisation / disambiguation in the BioNLP community .
4229objective to learn semantics from distributional representations ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ) .
Domain - speciﬁc pretraining on biomedical corpora ( e.g. BIOBERT , Lee et al . 2020 and BIOMEGATRON , Shin et al . 2020 ) have made much progress in biomedical text mining tasks .
Nonetheless , representing medical entities with the existing SOTA pretrained MLMs ( e.g. PUBMEDBERT , Gu et al . 2020 ) as suggested in Fig .
1 ( left ) does not lead to a well - separated representation space .
To address the aforementioned issue , we propose to pretrain a Transformer - based language model on the biomedical knowledge graph of UMLS ( Bodenreider , 2004 ) , the largest interlingua of biomedical ontologies .
UMLS contains a comprehensive collection of biomedical synonyms in various forms ( UMLS 2020AA has 4M+ concepts and 10M+ synonyms which stem from over 150 controlled vocabularies including MeSH , SNOMED CT , RxNorm , Gene Ontology and OMIM).4We design a selfalignment objective that clusters synonyms of the same concept .
To cope with the immense size of UMLS , we sample hard training pairs from the knowledge base and use a scalable metric learning loss .
We name our model as Self - aligning pretrained BERT ( SAPBERT ) .
Being both simple and powerful , SAPBERTobtains new SOTA performances across all six MEL benchmark datasets .
In contrast with the current systems which adopt complex pipelines and hybrid components ( Xu et al . , 2020 ; Ji et al . , 2020 ; Sung et al . , 2020 ) , SAPBERT applies a much simpler training procedure without requiring any pre- or post - processing steps .
At test time , a simple nearest neighbour ’s search is sufﬁcient for making a prediction .
When compared with other domain - speciﬁc pretrained language models ( e.g. BIOBERT and SCIBERT),SAPBERT also brings substantial improvement by up to 20 % on accuracy across all tasks .
The effectiveness of the pretraining in SAPBERTis especially highlighted in the scientiﬁc language domain where SAPBERToutperforms previous SOTA even without ﬁne - tuning on any MEL datasets .
We also provide insights on pretraining ’s impact across domains and explore pretraining with fewer model parameters by using a recently introduced A DAPTER module in our training scheme .

The left graph shows the distribution of + andpairs which are easy and already well - separated .
The right graph illustrates larger overlap between the two groups generated by the online mining step , making them harder and more informative for learning .
2 Method : Self - Alignment Pretraining We design a metric learning framework that learns to self - align synonymous biomedical entities .
The framework can be used as both pretraining on UMLS , and ﬁne - tuning on task - speciﬁc datasets .
We use an existing BERT model as our starting point .
In the following , we introduce the key components of our framework .
Formal Deﬁnition .
Let(x;y)2 X Y denote a tuple of a name and its categorical label .
For the self - alignment pretraining step , XY is the set of all ( name , CUI5 ) pairs in UMLS , e.g. ( Remdesivir , C4726677 ) ; while for the ﬁnetuning step , it is formed as an entity mention and its corresponding mapping from the ontology , e.g. ( scratchy throat , 102618009 ) .
Given any pair of tuples ( xi;yi);(xj;yj)2XY , the goal of the self - alignment is to learn a function f(; ) :X !
Rdparameterised by .
Then , the similarityhf(xi);f(xj)i(in this work we use cosine similarity ) can be used to estimate the resemblance ofxiandxj(i.e . , high if xi;xjare synonyms and low otherwise ) .
We model fby a BERT model with its output
[ CLS ] token regarded as the representation of the input.6During the learning , a sampling procedure selects the informative pairs of training samples and uses them in the pairwise metric learning loss function ( introduced shortly ) .
Online Hard Pairs Mining .
We use an online hard triplet mining condition to ﬁnd the most 5In UMLS , CUI is the Concept Unique Identiﬁer .
6We tried multiple strategies including ﬁrst - token , meanpooling , [ CLS ] and also NOSPEC ( recommended by Vuli ´ c et al . 2020 ) but found no consistent best strategy ( optimal strategy varies on different * B ERTs ) .
4230informative training examples ( i.e. hard positive / negative pairs ) within a mini - batch for efﬁcient training , Fig .
2 . For biomedical entities , this step can be particularly useful as most examples can be easily classiﬁed while a small set of very hard ones cause the most challenge to representation learning.7We start from constructing all possible triplets for all names within the mini - batch where each triplet is in the form of ( xa;xp;xn ) .
Here xais called anchor , an arbitrary name in the minibatch;xpa positive match of xa(i.e.ya = yp ) and xna negative match of xa(i.e.ya6 = yn ) .
Among the constructed triplets , we select out all triplets that violate the following condition : kf(xa) f(xp)k2 < kf(xa) f(xn)k2+;(1 )
whereis a pre - set margin .
In other words , we only consider triplets with the negative sample closer to the positive sample by a margin of . These are the hard triplets as their original representations were very far from correct .
Every hard triplet contributes one hard positive pair ( xa;xp ) and one hard negative pair ( xa;xn ) .
We collect all such positive & negative pairs and denote them asP;N.
A similar but not identical triplet mining condition was used by Schroff et al .
( 2015 ) for face recognition to select hard negative samples .
Switching - off this mining process , causes a drastic performance drop ( see Tab . 2 ) .
Loss Function .
We compute the pairwise cosine similarity of all the BERT - produced name representations and obtain a similarity matrix S2 RjXbjjX bjwhere each entry Sijcorresponds to the cosine similarity between the i - th andj - th names in the mini - batch b.
We adapted the Multi - Similarity loss ( MS loss , Wang et al . 2019 ) , a SOTA metric learning objective on visual recognition , for learning from the positive and negative pairs : L=1 jXbjjXbjX i=1   1  log 1 + X n2Nie  ( Sin ) +1  log 1 + X p2Pie   ( Sip ) !
; ( 2 ) where  ;   are temperature scales ; is an offset applied on the similarity matrix ; Pi;Niare indices 7Most of Hydroxychloroquine ’s variants are easy : Hydroxychlorochin , Hydroxychloroquine ( substance ) , Hidroxicloroquina , but a few can be very hard : Plaquenil andHCQ .of
positive and negative samples of the anchori.8 While the ﬁrst term in Eq . 2 pushes negative pairs away from each other , the second term pulls positive pairs together .
This dynamic allows for a re - calibration of the alignment space using the semantic biases of synonymy relations .
The MS loss leverages similarities among and between positive and negative pairs to re - weight the importance of the samples .
The most informative pairs will receive more gradient signals during training and thus can better use the information stored in data .
3 Experiments and Discussions 3.1 Experimental Setups Data Preparation Details for UMLS Pretraining .
We download the full release of UMLS 2020AA version.9We then extract all English entries from the MRCONSO.RFF raw ﬁle and convert all entity names into lowercase ( duplicates are removed ) .
Besides synonyms deﬁned inMRCONSO.RFF , we also include tradenames of drugs as synonyms ( extracted from MRREL.RRF ) .
After pre - processing , a list of 9,712,959 ( name , CUI ) entries is obtained .
However , random batching on this list can lead to very few ( if not none ) positive pairs within a mini - batch .
To ensure sufﬁcient positives present in each mini - batch , we generate ofﬂine positive pairs in the format of ( name 1 , name 2 , CUI ) where name 1and name 2have the same CUI label .
This can be achieved by enumerating all possible combinations of synonym pairs with common CUIs .
For balanced training , any concepts with more than 50 positive pairs are randomly trimmed to 50 pairs .
In the end we obtain a training list with 11,792,953 pairwise entries .
UMLS Pretraining Details .
During training , we use AdamW ( Loshchilov and Hutter , 2018 ) with a learning rate of 2e-5 and weight decay rate of 1e-2 .
Models are trained on the prepared pairwise UMLS data for 1 epoch ( approximately 50k iterations ) with a batch size of 512 ( i.e. , 256 pairs per mini - batch ) .
We train with Automatic Mixed Precision ( AMP)10provided in PyTorch 1.7.0 .
This takes approximately 5 hours on our machine ( con8We explored several loss functions such as InfoNCE ( Oord et al . , 2018 ) , NCA loss ( Goldberger et al . , 2005 ) , simple cosine loss ( Phan et al . , 2019 ) , max - margin triplet loss ( Basaldella et al . , 2020 ) but found our choice is empirically better .

Evaluation Data and Protocol .
We experiment on 6 different English MEL datasets : 4 in the scientiﬁc domain ( NCBI , Do ˘gan et
al . 2014 ; BC5CDR - c and BC5CDR - d , Li et al . 2016 ; MedMentions , Mohan and Li 2018 ) and 2 in the social media domain ( COMETA , Basaldella
et al . 2020 and AskAPatient , Limsopatham and Collier 2016 ) .
Descriptions of the datasets and their statistics are provided in App .
§ A. We report Acc @1and Acc @5(denoted as@1and@5 ) for evaluating performance .
In all experiments , SAPBERTdenotes further pretraining with our self - alignment method on UMLS .
At the test phase , for all SAPBERT models we use nearest neighbour search without further ﬁne - tuning on task data ( unless stated otherwise ) .
Except for numbers reported in previous papers , all results are the average of ﬁve runs with different random seeds .
Fine - Tuning on Task Data .
The red rows in Tab . 1 are results of models ( further ) ﬁne - tuned on the training sets of the six MEL datasets .
Similar to pretraining , a positive pair list is generated through traversing the combinations of mention and all ground truth synonyms where mentions are fromthe training set and ground truth synonyms are from the reference ontology .
We use the same optimiser and learning rates but train with a batch size of 256 ( to accommodate the memory of 1 GPU ) .
On scientiﬁc language datasets , we train for 3 epochs while on AskAPatient and COMETA we train for 15 and 10 epochs respectively .
For BIOSYNon social media language datasets , we empirically found that 10 epochs work the best .
Other conﬁgurations are the same as the original B IOSYNpaper .
3.2 Main Results and Analysis * BERT + SAPBERT ( Tab . 1 , top ) .
We illustrate the impact of SAPBERT pretraining over 7 existingBERT - based models ( * BERT = { BIOBERT , PUBMEDBERT , ... } ) .
SAPBERT obtains consistent improvement over all * BERTmodels across all datasets , with larger gains ( by up to 31.0 % absolute Acc @1increase ) observed in the social media domain .
While SCIBERTis the leading model before applying SAPBERT , PUBMEDBERT+SAPBERT performs the best afterwards .
SAPBERT vs. SOTA ( Tab . 1 , bottom ) .
We take PUBMEDBERT+SAPBERT(w / wo ﬁne - tuning ) and compare against various published SOTA results ( see App .
§ C.1 for a full listing of 10 baselines )
4232which
all require task supervision .
For the scientiﬁc language domain , the SOTA is BIOSYN(Sung et
al . , 2020 ) .
For the social media domain , the SOTA are Basaldella et al .
( 2020 ) and GENRANK ( Xu et
al . , 2020 ) on COMETA and AskAPatient respectively .
All these SOTA methods combine BERT with heuristic modules such as tf - idf , string matching and information retrieval system ( i.e. Apache Lucene ) in a multi - stage manner .
Measured by Acc @1,SAPBERT achieves new SOTA with statistical signiﬁcance on 5 of the 6 datasets and for the dataset ( BC5CDR - c ) where SAPBERTis not signiﬁcantly better , it performs on par with SOTA ( 96.5 vs. 96.6 ) .
Interestingly , on scientiﬁc language datasets , SAPBERT outperforms SOTA without any task supervision ( ﬁne - tuning mostly leads to overﬁtting and performance drops ) .
On social media language datasets , unsupervised SAPBERTlags behind supervised SOTA by large margins , highlighting the well - documented complex nature of social media language ( Baldwin et al . , 2013 ; Limsopatham and Collier , 2015 , 2016 ; Basaldella et al . , 2020 ; Tutubalina et al . , 2020 ) .
However , after ﬁne - tuning on the social media datasets ( using the MS loss introduced earlier ) , SAPBERT outperforms SOTA signiﬁcantly , indicating that knowledge acquired during the selfaligning pretraining can be adapted to a shifted domain without much effort .
The A DAPTER Variant .
As an option for parameter efﬁcient pretraining , we explore a variant of SAPBERTusing a recently introduced training module named ADAPTER ( Houlsby et al . , 2019 ) .
While maintaining the same pretraining scheme with the same SAPBERTonline mining + MS loss , instead of training from the full model of PUBMEDBERT , we insert new ADAPTER layers between Transformer layers of the ﬁxed PUBMEDBERT , and only train the weights of these ADAPTER layers .
In our experiments , we use the enhanced ADAPTER conﬁguration by Pfeiffer et al .
( 2020 ) .
We include two variants where trained parameters are 13.22 % and 1.09 % of the full SAPBERTvariant .
The ADAPTER variant of SAPBERTachieves comparable performance to full - model - tuning in scientiﬁc datasets but lags behind in social media datasets , Tab .
1 .
The results indicate that more parameters are needed in pretraining for knowledge transfer to a shifted domain , in our case , the social media datasets .
The Impact of Online Mining ( Eq . ( 1 ) ) .
As suggested in Tab . 2 , switching off the online hard pairs mining procedure causes a large performance drop in @1and a smaller but still signiﬁcant drop in@5 .
This is due to the presence of many easy and already well - separated samples in the mini - batches .
These uninformative training examples dominated the gradients and harmed the learning process .

Integrating S APBERT in Existing Systems .
SAPBERT can be easily inserted into existing BERT - based MEL systems by initialising the systems with SAPBERT pretrained weights .
We use the SOTA scientiﬁc language system , BIOSYN ( originally initialised with BIOBERTweights ) , as an example and show the performance is boosted across all datasets ( last two rows , Tab . 1 ) .
4 Conclusion We present SAPBERT , a self - alignment pretraining scheme for learning biomedical entity representations .
We highlight the consistent performance boost achieved by SAPBERT , obtaining new SOTA in all six widely used MEL benchmarking datasets .
Strikingly , without any ﬁne - tuning on task - speciﬁc labelled data , SAPBERT already outperforms the previous supervised SOTA ( sophisticated hybrid entity linking systems ) on multiple datasets in the scientiﬁc language domain .
Our work opens new avenues to explore for general domain self - alignment ( e.g. by leveraging knowledge graphs such as DBpedia ) .
We plan to incorporate other types of relations ( i.e. , hypernymy and hyponymy ) and extend our model to sentence - level representation learning .
In particular , our ongoing work using a combination of SAPBERT andADAPTER is a promising direction for tackling sentence - level tasks .

A Evaluation Datasets Details We divide our experimental datasets into two categories ( 1 ) scientiﬁc language datasests where the data is extracted from scientiﬁc papers and ( 2 ) social media language datasets where the data is coming from social media forums like Reddit.com .
For an overview of the key statistics , see Tab .
3 . A.1 Scientiﬁc Language Datasets NCBI disease ( Do ˘gan et
al . , 2014 ) is a corpus containing 793 fully annotated PubMed abstracts and 6,881 mentions .
The mentions are mapped into the MEDIC dictionary ( Davis et al . , 2012 ) .
We denote this dataset as “ NCBI ” in our experiments .
BC5CDR ( Li et
al . , 2016 ) consists of 1,500 PubMed articles with 4,409 annotated chemicals , 5,818 diseases and 3,116 chemical - disease interactions .
The disease mentions are mapped into the MEDIC dictionary like the NCBI disease corpus .
The chemical mentions are mapped into the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ) ( Davis et al . , 2019 ) chemical dictionary .
We denote the disease and chemical mention sets as “ BC5CDRd ” and “ BC5CDR - c ” respectively .
For NCBI and BC5CDR we use the same data and evaluation protocol by Sung et al .
( 2020).11 MedMentions ( Mohan and Li , 2018 ) is a verylarge - scale entity linking dataset containing over 4,000 abstracts and over 350,000 mentions linked to UMLS 2017AA .
According to Mohan and Li ( 2018 ) , training TAGGER ONE(Leaman and Lu , 2016 ) , a very popular MEL system , on a subset of MedMentions require > 900 GB of RAM .
Its massive number of mentions and more importantly the used reference ontology ( UMLS 2017AA has 3M+ concepts ) make the application of most MEL systems infeasible .
However , through our metric learning formulation , SAPBERTcan be applied on MedMentions with minimal effort .
A.2 Social - Media Language Datasets AskAPatient ( Limsopatham and Collier , 2016 ) includes 17,324 adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) annotations collected from askapatient.com blog posts .
The mentions are mapped to 1,036 medical concepts grounded onto SNOMED - CT ( Donnelly , 2006 ) and AMT ( the Australian Medicines Terminology ) .
For this dataset , we follow the 10 - fold evaluation protocol stated in the original paper.12 COMETA ( Basaldella et al . , 2020 ) is a recently released large - scale MEL dataset that speciﬁcally focuses on MEL in the social media domain , containing around 20k medical mentions extracted from health - related discussions on reddit.com .
Mentions are mapped to SNOMED - CT .
We use the “ stratiﬁed ( general ) ” split and follow the evaluation protocol of the original paper.13 B Model & Training Details B.1 The Choice of Base Models We list all the versions of BERT models used in this study , linking to the speciﬁc versions in Tab . 5 .
Note that we exhaustively tried all ofﬁcial variants of the selected models and the best performing ones are chosen .
All BERTmodels refer to the BERT Base architecture in this paper .

B.2 Comparing Loss Functions We use COMETA ( zeroshot general ) as a benchmark for selecting learning objectives .
Note that this split of COMETA is different from the stratiﬁed - general split used in Tab .
4 .
It is very challenging ( so easy to see the difference of the performance ) and also does not directly affect the model ’s performance on other datasets .
The results are listed in Tab .
6 . Note that online mining is switched on for all models here .

Numbers reported are on COMETA ( zeroshot general ) .
The cosine loss was used by Phan et al .
( 2019 ) for learning UMLS synonyms for LSTM models .
The max - margin triplet loss was used by Basaldellaet al .
( 2020 ) for training MEL models .
A very similar ( though not identical ) hinge - loss was used by Schumacher et al .
( 2020 ) for clinical concept linking .
InfoNCE has been very popular in selfsupervised learning and contrastive learning ( Oord et al . , 2018 ; He et al . , 2020 ) .
Lifted - Structure loss ( Oh Song et al . , 2016 ) and NCA loss ( Goldberger et al . , 2005 ) are two very classic metric learning objectives .
Multi - Similarity loss ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) and Circle loss ( Sun et al . , 2020 ) are two recently proposed metric learning objectives and have been considered as SOTA on large - scale visual recognition benchmarks .
