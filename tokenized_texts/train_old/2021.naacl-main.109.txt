Abstract Abstractive conversation summarization has received much attention recently .
However , these generated summaries often suffer from insufﬁcient , redundant , or incorrect content , largely due to the unstructured and complex characteristics of human - human interactions .
To this end , we propose to explicitly model the rich structures in conversations for more precise and accurate conversation summarization , by ﬁrst incorporating discourse relations between utterances and action triples ( “ WHO DOING -WHAT ” ) in utterances through structured graphs to better encode conversations , and then designing a multi - granularity decoder to generate summaries by combining all levels of information .
Experiments show that our proposed models outperform state - of - theart methods and generalize well in other domains in terms of both automatic evaluations and human judgments .
We have publicly released our code at https://github.com/ GT - SALT / Structure - Aware - BART .
1 Introduction Online interaction has become an indispensable component of everyday life and people are increasingly using textual conversations to exchange ideas , make plans , and share information .
However , it is time - consuming to recap and grasp all the core content within every complex conversation ( Gao et al . , 2020 ; Feng et
al . , 2020 ) .
As a result , how to organize massive everyday interactions into natural , concise , and informative text , i.e. , abstractive conversation summarization , starts to gain importance .
Signiﬁcant progress has been made on abstractive summarization for structured document via pointer generator ( See et al . , 2017 ) , reinforcement methods ( Paulus et al . , 2018 ;
Huang et al . , 2020a ) and pre - trained models ( Liu and Lapata , 2019 ; Lewis et al . , 2020 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) .
Despite the huge success , it is challenging to directly apply document models to summarize conversations , due to Figure 1 : An example of discourse relation graph ( a ) and action graph ( b ) from one conversation in SAMSum ( Gliwa et al . , 2019 ) .
The annotated summary is Simon was on the phone before , so he did n’t here Helen calling .
Simon will fetch Helen some tissues .
a set of inherent differences between conversations and documents ( Gliwa et al . , 2019 ) .
First , speaker interruptions like repetitions , false - starts , and hesitations are frequent in conversations ( Sacks et al . , 1978 ) , and key information resides in different portions of a conversation .
These unstructured properties pose challenges for models to focus on salient contents that are necessary for generating both abstractive and informative summaries .
Second , there is more than one speaker in conversations and people interact with each other in different language styles ( Zhu et al . , 2020b ) .
The complex interactions among multiple speakers make it harder for mod-
1381els to identify and associate speakers with correct actions so as to generate factual summaries .
In order to summarize the unstructured and complex conversations , a growing body of research has been conducted , such as transferring document summarization methods to conversation settings ( Shang et al . , 2018 ; Gliwa et al . , 2019 ) , adopting hierarchical models ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ; Zhu et al . , 2020b ) , or incorporating conversation structures like topic segmentation ( Liu et al . , 2019b ; Li et al . , 2019 ; Chen and Yang , 2020 ) , dialogue acts ( Goo and Chen , 2018 ) , and conversation stages ( Chen and Yang , 2020 ) .
However , current approaches still face challenges in terms of succinctness and faithfulness , as most prior studies ( i ) fail to explicitly model dependencies between utterances which can help identify salient portions of conversations ( Bui et al . , 2009 ) , and ( ii ) lack structured representations ( Huang et al . , 2020a ) to learn the associations between speakers , actions and events .
We argue that these rich linguistic structures associated with conversations are key components towards generating abstractive and factual conversation summaries .
To this end , we present a structure - aware sequence - to - sequence model , in which we equip abstractive conversation summarization models with rich conversation structures through two types of graphs : discourse relation graph andaction graph .
Discourse relation graphs are constructed based on dependency - based discourse relations ( Kirschner et al . , 2012 ; Stone et al . , 2013 ; Asher et al . , 2016 ;
Qin et al . , 2017 ) between intertwined utterances , where each Elementary Discourse Unit ( EDU ) is one single utterance and they are linked through 16 different types of relations ( Asher et al . , 2016 ) .
As shown in Figure 1(a ) , highly related utterances are linked based on discourse relations likeQuestion Answer Pairs , Comment andExplanation .
Explicitly modeling these utterances relations in conversations can aid models in recognizing key content for succinct and informative summarization .
Action graphs are constructed as the “ WHO -DOING -WHAT ” triplets in conversations which express socially situated identities and activities ( Gee , 2014 ) .
For instance , in Figure 1(b ) , the action graph provides explicit information between Simon , fetch , and tissues for the utterance it is Simon who will fetch the tissues , making models less likely to generate summaries with wrong references ( e.g. , Helen will fetch the tissues ) .
To sum up , our contributions are : ( 1 ) We pro - pose to utilize discourse relation graphs and action graphs to better encode conversations for conversation summarization .
( 2 ) We design structureaware sequence - to - sequence models to combine these structured graphs and generate summaries with the help of a novel multi - granularity decoder .
( 3 ) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through experiments on a largescale conversation summarization dataset , SAMSum ( Gliwa et al . , 2019 ) .
( 4 ) We further show that our structure - aware models can generalize well in new domains such as debate summarization .
2 Related Work Document Summarization Compared to extractive document summarization ( Gupta and Lehal , 2010 ; Narayan et al . , 2018 ; Liu and Lapata , 2019 ) , abstractive document summarization is generally considered more challenging and has received more attention .
Various methods have been designed to tackle abstractive document summarization like sequence - to - sequence models ( Rush et al . , 2015 ) ,
pointer generators ( See et al . , 2017 ) , reinforcement learning methods ( Paulus et al . , 2018 ; Huang et al . , 2020a ) and pre - trained models ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) .
To generate faithful abstractive document summaries ( Maynez et al . , 2020 ) , graphbased models were introduced recently such as extracting entity types ( Fernandes et al . , 2018 ; Fan et al . , 2019 ) , leveraging knowledge graphs ( Huang et al . , 2020a ; Zhu et al . , 2020a ) or designing extra fact correction modules ( Dong et al . , 2020 ) .
Inspired by these graph - based methods , we also construct action graphs for generating more factual conversation summaries .
Conversation Summarization Extractive dialogue summarization ( Murray et al . , 2005 ) has been studied extensively via statistical machine learning methods such as skip - chain CRFs ( Galley , 2006 ) , SVM with LDA models ( Wang and Cardie , 2013 ) , and multi - sentence compression algorithms ( Shang et al . , 2018 ) .
Such methods struggled with generating succinct , ﬂuent , and natural summaries , especially when the key information needs to be aggregated from multiple ﬁrst - person point - of - view utterances ( Song et al . , 2020 ) .
Abstractive conversation summarization overcomes these issues by designing hierarchical models ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ; Zhu et al . , 2020b ) , incorporating commonsense knowledge ( Feng et al . , 2020 ) , or leveraging conversational structures like dialogue acts ( Goo and Chen ,
1382 Figure 2 : Model architecture .
Each utterance is encoded via transformer encoder ; discourse relation graphs and action graphs are encoded through Graph Attention Networks ( a ) .

2018 ) , key point sequences ( Liu et al . , 2019a ) , topic segments ( Liu et al . , 2019b ; Li et
al . , 2019 ) and stage developments ( Chen and Yang , 2020 ) .
Some recent research has also utilized discourse relations as input features in classiﬁers to detect important content in conversations ( Murray et al . , 2006 ; Bui et al . , 2009 ; Qin et al . , 2017 ) .
However , current models still have not explicitly utilized the dependencies between different utterances , making models hard to leverage long - range dependencies and utilize these salient utterances .
Moreover , less attention has been paid to identify the actions of different speakers and how they interact with or refer to each other , leading to unfaithful summarization with incorrect references or wrong reasoning ( Gliwa et al . , 2019 ) .
To ﬁll these gaps , we propose to explicitly model actions within utterances , and relations between utterances in conversations in a structured way , by using discourse relation graphs and action graphs and further combining these through relational graph encoders and multigranularity decoders for abstractive conversation summarization .
3 Methods To generate abstractive and factual summaries from unstructured conversations , we propose to model structural signals in conversations by ﬁrst constructing discourse relation graphs and action graphs ( Section 3.1 ) , and then encoding the graphs together with conversations ( Section 3.2 ) as well as incorporating these different levels of information in the decoding stage through a multi - granularitydecoder ( Section 3.3 ) to summarize given conversations .
The overall architecture is shown in Figure 2 .
3.1 Structured Graph Construction
This section describes how to construct the discourse relation graphs and action graphs .
Formally , for a given conversation C = fu0;:::;umg withmutterances , we construct discourse relation graphGD= ( VD;ED ) , where VDis the set of nodes representing Elementary Discourse Units ( EDUs ) , and EDis the adjacent matrix that describes the relations between EDUs , and action graphGA= ( VA;EA ) , where VAis the set of nodes representing “ WHO ” , “ DOING ” and “ WHAT ” arguments , and EAis the adjacent matrix to link “ WHO -DOING -WHAT ” triples .
Discourse Relation Graph Utterances from different speakers do not occur in isolation ; instead , they are related within the context of discourse ( Murray et al . , 2006 ;
Qin et al . , 2017 ) , which has been shown effective for dialogue understanding like identifying the decisions in multi - party dialogues ( Bui et al . , 2009 ) and detecting salient content in email conversations ( McKeown et al . , 2007 ) .
Although current attention - based neural models are supposed to , or might implicitly , learn certain relations between utterances , they often struggle to focus on many informative utterances ( Chen and Yang , 2020 ;
Song et al . , 2020 ) and fail to address long - range dependencies ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) , especially when there are frequent interruptions .
As a result , explicitly incorporating the discourse relations will help neural summarization models better
1383encode the unstructured conversations and concentrate on the most salient utterances to generate more informative and less redundant summaries .
To do so , we view each utterance as an EDU and use the discourse relation types deﬁned in Asher et al .
( 2016 )
.
We ﬁrst pre - train a discourse parsing model ( Shi and Huang , 2019 ) on a humanannotated multiparty dialogue corpus ( Asher et al . , 2016 ) , with 0.775 F1 score on link predictions and 0.557 F1 score on relation classiﬁcations , which are comparable to the state - of - the - art results ( Shi and Huang , 2019 ) .
We then utilize this pre - trained parser to predict the discourse relations within conversations in our SAMSum corpus ( Gliwa et al . , 2019 ) .
After predictions , there are 138,554 edges identiﬁed in total and 8.48 edges per conversation .
The distribution of these predicted discourse relation types is : Comment ( 19.3 % ) , Clariﬁcation Question ( 15.2 % ) , Elaboration ( 2.3 % ) , Acknowledgement(8.4 % ) , Continuation ( 10.1 % ) , Explanation ( 2.8 % ) , Conditional ( 0.2 % ) , Question Answer Pair ( 21.5 % ) , Alternation ( 0.3 % ) , Q - Elab ( 2.5 % ) , Result ( 5.5 % ) , Background ( 0.4 % ) , Narration ( 0.4 % ) , Correction ( 0.4 % ) , Parallel ( 0.9 % ) , and Contrast ( 1.0 % ) .
Then for each conversation , we construct a discourse relation graph GD= ( VD;ED ) , where VD[k]represents the k - th utterance .
ED[i][j ]
= r if there is a link from the i - th utterance to the j - th one with discourse relation r. Action Graph The “ who - doing - what ” triples from utterances can provide explicit visualizations of speakers and their actions , the key to understanding concrete details happened in conversations ( Moser , 2001 ; Gee , 2014 ; Sacks et al . , 1978 ) .
Simply relying on neural models to identify this information from conversations often fail to produce factual characterizations of concrete details happened ( Cao et al . , 2018 ; Huang et al . , 2020a ) .
To this end , we extract “ WHO -DOING -WHAT ” triples from utterances and construct action graphs for conversation summarization ( Chen et al . , 2019 ; Huang et al . , 2020b , a ) .
Speciﬁcally , we ﬁrst transform the ﬁrst - person point - of - view utterances to its thirdperson point - of - view forms based on simple rules : ( i ) substituting ﬁrst / second - person pronouns with the names of current speaker or surrounding speakers and ( ii ) replacing third - person pronouns based on coreference clusters in conversations detected by the Stanford CoreNLP ( Manning et al . , 2014 ) .
For example , an utterance “ I ’ll bring it to you to - morrow ” from Amanda to Jerry will be transformed into “ Amanda’ll bring cakes to Jerry tomorrow ” .
Then we extract “ WHO -DOING -WHAT ” ( subjectpredicate - object ) triples from transformed conversations using the open information extraction ( OpenIE ) systems1(Angeli et al . , 2015 ) .
We then construct the Action Graph GA= ( VA;EA)from the extracted triples by taking arguments ( “ WHO ” , “ DOING ” , or “ WHAT ” ) as nodes in VA , and connect them with edge EA[i][j ] = 1 if they are adjacent in one “ WHO -DOING -WHAT ” triple .
3.2 Encoder Given a conversation and its corresponding discourse relation graph and action graph , we utilize an utterance encoder and two graph encoders , to obtain its hidden representations shown in Figure 2(a ) .
3.2.1 Utterance Encoder We initialize our utterance encoder FU(:)with a pre - trained encoder , i.e. , BART - base ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ) , and encode tokens fxi;0;:::;x i;lgin an utterance uiinto its hidden representation : fhU i;0;:::;hU i;lg = FU(fxi;0;:::;x i;lg ) ( 1 ) Here we add a special token xi;0=<S > at the beginning of each utterance to represent it .
3.2.2 Graph Encoder Node Initialization For discourse relation graph , we employ the output embeddings of the special tokens xi;0from
the utterance encoder , i.e. , hU i;0 , to initialize the i - th nodevD iinGD .
We use a one - hot embedding layer to encode the relations ED[i][j ] = eD i;jbetween utterance iandj .
For action graph , we ﬁrst utilize FU(:)to encode each token in nodes vA iand then average their output embeddings as their initial representations .
Structured Graph Attention Network Based on Graph Attention Network (
Veli ˇckovi ´ c et al . , 2018 ) , we utilize these relations between nodes to encode each node vD iinGDorvA iinGAthrough :  ij = exp    aT[WvikWvjkWeei;j] P k2N iexp ( (aT[WvikWvkkWeei;k ] ) )

= Softmax ( Wp^y)(5 ) To better incorporate the information in constructed graphs , different from the traditional pretrained BART model ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ) , we improve the BART transformer decoder with two extra cross attentions ( Discourse Attention and Action Attention ) added to each decoder layer , which attends to the encoded node representations in discourse relation graphs and action graphs .
In each decoder layer , after performing the original cross attentions over every token in utterances fhU i;0 : lgand getting the utterance - attended representationxU , multi - granularity decoder then conducts cross attentions over nodes fhD 0 : mgandfhA 0 : ngthat are encoded from graph encoders in parallel , to obtain the discourse - attended representation xD and action - attended representation xA. These two attended vectors are then combined into a structureaware representation xS , through a feed - forward network for further forward passing in the decoder .
To alleviate the negative impact of randomly initialized graph encoders and cross attentions over graphs on pre - trained BART decoders atearly stages and accelerate the learning of newlyintroduced modules during training , we apply ReZero ( Bachlechner et al . , 2020 ) to the residual connection after attending to graphs in each decoder layer : ~xS = xU+  xS(6 ) where  is one trainable parameter instead of a ﬁxed value 1 , which modulates updates from cross attentions over graphs .
Training During training , we seek to minimize the cross entropy and use the teacher - forcing strategy ( Bengio et al . , 2015 ): L= X logP(~yljy < l;C;GD;GA)(7 ) 4 Experiments 4.1 Datasets We trained and evaluated our models on a conversation summarization dataset SAMSum ( Gliwa et al . , 2019 ) covering messenger - like conversations about daily topics , such as arranging meetings and discussing events .
We also showed the generalizability of our models on the Argumentative Dialogue Summary Corpus ( ADSC ) ( Misra et al . , 2015 ) , a debate summarization corpus .
The data statistics of two datasets were shown in Table 1 , with the discourse relation types distributions in the Appendix .

Here we implemented it based on BART - base models .
4.3 Implementation Details We used the BART - base model to initialize our sequence - to - sequence model for training in all experiments .
For parameters in the original BART encoder / decoder , we followed the default settings and set the learning rate 3e-5 with 120 warm - up steps .
For graph encoders , we set the number of hidden dimensions as 768 , the number of attention heads as 2 , the number of layers as 2 , and the dropout rate as 0.2 .
For graph cross attentions added to BART decoder layers , we set the number of attention heads as 2 .
The weights  in ReZero residual connections were initialized with 1 .
The learning rate for parameters in newly added modules was 3e-4 with 60 warm - up steps .

We found that , compared to simple sequence - to - sequence models ( Pointer Generator andTransformer ) , incorporating extra information such as commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet ( D - HGN ) increased the ROUGE metrics .
When equipped with pre - trained models and simple conversation structures such as topics and conversation stages , Multi - View Seq2Seq boosted ROUGE scores .
Incorporating discourse relation graphs or action graphs helped the performances of summarization , suggesting the effectiveness of explicitly modeling relations between utterances and the associations between speakers and actions within utterances .
Combining two different structured graphs produced better ROUGE scores compared to previous state - of - the - art methods and our base models , 3We followed fairseq and used https://github . com / pltrdy / rouge to calculate ROUGE scores .
Note that different tools may result in different ROUGE scores .
1386with an increase of 2.0 % on ROUGE-1 , 4.3 % on ROUGE-2 , and 1.2 % on ROUGE - L compared to our base model , BART .
This indicates that , our structure - aware models with discourse and action graphs could help abstractive conversation summarization , and these two graphs complemented each other in generating better summaries .
Human Evaluation We conducted human evaluation to qualitatively evaluate the generated summaries .
Speciﬁcally , we asked annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk to score a set of randomly sampled 100 generated summaries from ground - truth , BART and our structured models , using a Likert scale from 1 ( worst ) to 5 ( best ) in terms of factualness ( e.g. , associates actions with the right actors ) , succinctness ( e.g. , does not contain redundant information ) , and informativeness ( e.g. , covers the most important content ) ( Feng et al . , 2020 ;
Huang et al . , 2020a ) .
To increase annotation quality , we required turkers to have a 98 % approval rate and at least 10,000 approved tasks for their previous work .
Each message was rated by three workers .
The scores for each summary were averaged .
The Intra - Class Correlation was 0.543 , showing moderate agreement ( Koo and Li , 2016 ) .
As shown in Table 4 , S - BART that utilized structured information from discourse relation graphs and action graphs generated signiﬁcantly better summaries with respect to factualness , succinctness , and informativeness .
This might because that the incorporation of structured information such as discourse relations helped S - BART to recognize the salient parts in conversations , and thus improve the succinctness and informativeness over BART .
Modeling the connections between speakers and actions greatly helped generate more factual summaries than the baselines , e.g. , with an increase of 0.27 from BART toS - BART w. Action .
4.5 Results on Out - Of - Domain Corpus To investigate the generalizability of our structureaware models , we then tested the S - BART model trained on SAMSum corpus directly on the debate summarization domain ( ADSC Corpus ( Misra et al . , 2015 ) ) in a zero - shot setting .
Besides the differences in topics , utterances in debate conversations were generally longer and include more action triples ( 37.20 vs 6.81 as shown in Table 1 ) and fewer participants .
The distribution of discourse relation types also differed a lot across differentGraph Types R-1 R-2 R - L S - BART w. Discourse Graph 45.89 22.50 44.83 S - BART w. Random Graph 45.28 21.80 44.30

domains4(e.g . , more Contrast in debates ( 19.5 % ) than in daily conversations ( 1.0 % ) ) .
As shown in Table 3 , our single graph modelsS - BART w. Discourse andS - BART w. Action boosted ROUGE scores compared to BART , suggesting that utilizing structures can also increase the generalizability of conversation summarization methods .
However , contrary to in - domain results in Table 2 , action graphs led to much more gains than discourse graphs .
This indicated that when domain shifts , action triples were most robust in terms of zero - shot setups ; differences in discourse relation distributions could limit such generalization .
Consistent with in - domain scenarios , our S - BART w. Discourse&Action achieved better results , with an increase of 66.2 % on ROUGE-1 , 373.4 % on ROUGE-2 , and 82.2 % on ROUGE - L over BART .
4.6 Ablation Studies This part conducted ablation studies to show the effectiveness of structured graphs in our S - BART .
The Quality of Discourse Relation Graphs We showed how the quality of discourse relation graphs affected the performances of conversation summarization in Table 5 .
Speciﬁcally , we compared the ROUGE scores of S - BART using our constructed discourse relation graphs ( S - BART w. Discourse Graph ) and S - BART using randomly generated discourse relation graphs S - BART w. Random Graph where both connections between nodes and relation types were randomized .
The number of edges in two graphs was kept the same .
We found that S - BART with our discourse graphs outperformed 4The detailed distributions were shown in the Appendix .
1387 Figure 3 : Averaged  over decoder layers in the trained S - BART models using different graphs models with random graphs , indicating the effectiveness of the constructed discourse relation graphs and the importance of their qualities .
Different Ways to Combine Graphs We experimented with different ways to combine discourse relation graphs and action graphs in our S - BART w. Discourse & Action , and presented the results in Table 6 .
Here , parallel strategy performed cross attentions on different graphs separately and then combined the attended results with feed - forward networks as discussed in Section 3.3 ; sequential strategy performed cross attentions on two graphs in a speciﬁc order ( from discourse relation graphs to actions graphs , or vice versa ) .
We found that the parallel strategy showed better performances and the sequential ones did not introduce gains compared to S - BART with single graphs .
This demonstrates that discourse relation graphs and action graphs were both important and provided different signals for abstractive conversation summarization .
Visualizing ReZero Weights We further tested our structure - aware BART with two ReZero settings : ( i ) initializing  from 0 , ( ii ) initializing   from 1 , and found initializing  from 1 would bring in more performance gains ( see Appendix ) .
We then visualized the average  over different decoder layers after training in Figure 3 , and observed that ( i ) when  was initialized with 1 , the ﬁnal  was much larger than the setting where  was initialized with 0 , which might because randomly initialized modules barely received supervisions at early stages and therefore contributes less to BART .
( ii ) Compared to discourse graphs , action graphs received higher  weights after training in both initializing settings , suggesting that the information from structured action graphs might be harder for the end - to - end BART models to capture .
( iii ) Utilizing both graphs spontaneously led to higherConversations # Num # Dis .

4.7 Error Analyses To inspect when our summarization models could help the conversations summarization , we visualized the average number of discourse edges and the average number of action triples in three sets of conversations in Table 7 : ( i ) Similar : examples where S - BART generated similar ROUGE scores ( the differences were less than 0.1 ) compared to BART ; ( ii)Increase : examples where S - BART resulted in higher ROUGE scores ( the differences were larger than 1.0 ) compared to BART ; ( iii ) Challenging : examples where both S - BART andBART showed low ROUGE scores ( ROUGE-1 < 20.0 , ROUGE-2 < 10.0 , ROUGE - L < 10.0 ) .
When the structures in conversations were simpler ( fewer discourse edges and fewer action triples than the average ) , BART showed similar performance as S - BART .
As the structures of conversations become more complex with more discourse relations and more action mentions , S - BART outperformed BART as it explicitly incorporated these structured graphs .
However , both BART andSBART struggled when there were much more interactions beyond certain thresholds , calling for better mechanisms to model structures in conversations for generating better summaries .
5 Conclusion In this work , we introduced a structure - aware sequence - to - sequence model for abstractive conversation summarization by incorporating discourse relations between utterances , and the connections between speakers and actions within utterances .
Experiments and ablation studies on SAMSum corpus showed the effectiveness of these structured graphs in aiding the task of conversation summarization via both quantitative and qualitative eval-
1388uation metrics .
Results in zero - shot settings on ADCS Corpus further demonstrated the generalizability of our structure - aware models .
In the future , we plan to extend our current conversation summarization models for various application domains such as emails , debates , and podcasts , and in conversations that might involve longer utterances and more participants in an unsynchronized way .
