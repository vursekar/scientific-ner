Abstract Most existing relation extraction approaches exclusively target binary relations , and n - ary relation extraction is relatively unexplored .
Current state - of - the - art n - ary relation extraction method is based on a supervised learning approach and , therefore , may suffer from the lack of sufﬁcient relation labels .
In this paper , we propose a novel approach to cross - sentence n - ary relation extraction based on universal schemas .
To alleviate the sparsity problem and to leverage inherent decomposability of n - ary relations , we propose to learn relation representations of lower - arity facts that result from decomposing higher - arity facts .
The proposed method computes a score of a new nary fact by aggregating scores of its decomposed lower - arity facts .
We conduct experiments with datasets for ternary relation extraction and empirically show that our method improves the n - ary relation extraction performance compared to previous methods .
1 Introduction Relation extraction is a core natural language processing task which is concerned with the extraction of relations between entities from text .
It has numerous applications ranging from question answering ( Xu et
al . , 2016 ) to automated knowledge base construction ( Dong et al . , 2014 ) .
While the vast majority of existing research focuses on extracting binary relations , there exists only few recent approaches to extract n - ary relations , that is , relations among n2entities ( Li et al . , 2015 ; Ernst et al . , 2018 ) .
In n - ary relation extraction , relation mentions tend to span multiple sentences more frequently as nincreases .
Thus , Peng et al .
( 2017 ) recently extended the problem to cross - sentence n - ary relation extraction in which n - ary relations are extracted from multiple sentences .
As a motivating example , consider the following text from Wikipedia : “ Revisstarted off the 2009 season matched up against some of football ’s best wide receivers .
In Week 1 , he helped limit Houston Texans Pro - bowler Andre Johnson to four receptions for 35 yards . ”
In this example , two sentences collectively describes that Andre Johnson is a player of the football team the Texans during 2009 season , and thus we need cross - sentence information to correctly extract this ternary interaction among the three entities , i.e. Player ( Andre Johnson , Texans , 2009 season ) .
Previous methods ( Peng et al . , 2017 ; Song et al . , 2018 ) capture cross - sentence n - ary relation mentions by representing texts with a document graph which consists of both intra- and cross - sentence links between words .
With this graphical representation , they applied graph neural networks to predict ternary relations in the medical domain .
However , these methods train the neural networks in a supervised manner using distant supervision ( Mintz et al . , 2009 ) and , therefore , may suffer from the lack of sufﬁcient positive labels when a well - populated knowledge base is not available .
On the other hand , for binary relation extraction , the problem of insufﬁcient positive labels can be mitigated with universal schemas ( Riedel et al . , 2013 ) .
In a universal schema approach , textual representations ( surface patterns ) of entities and their relations are encoded into the same vector space as the canonical knowledge base relations .
Thus , semantically similar surface patterns can share information of relation labels in a semisupervised manner .
This reduces the amount of required labeled training data .
Applying the universal schema approach to n - ary ( n > 2 ) relation extraction is , however , not straight - forward due to the sparsity of higher - order relation mentions among a speciﬁc set of n>2entities.1This is be1In our Wiki-90k dataset ( see x4.1 ) , only 12.5 % of ternary entity tuples have at least two relations among the entities , while 77.3 % of entities appear at least twice .
6226cause the universal schema approach ( Riedel et al . , 2013 ) and its extensions ( Toutanova et al . , 2015 ; Verga et al . , 2016 , 2017 ) utilize co - occurring patterns of relation types between speciﬁc pair of entities .
Also , prior work has only addressed binary relations , and it is not trivial to deﬁne surface patterns among n >
2entities and to encode these patterns into a vector representation .
To mitigate the aforementioned sparsity problem and utilize existing encoders for binary and unary surface patterns , we propose to train universal schema models on more dense lower - arity ( unary and binary ) facts instead of original sparse n - ary facts .
Since most n - ary relations can be decomposed into a set of k - ary relations ( k= 1;2 ) which are implied by the n - ary relation,2we can easily acquire lower - arity facts by decomposing n - ary facts .
Our model learns representations of these lower - arity relations using the universal schema framework , and predicts new n - ary facts by aggregating scores of lower - arity facts .
To evaluate the proposed method , we create new cross - sentence n - ary relation extraction datasets with multiple ternary relations.3The new datasets contain more entity tuples with known relational facts appeared in a knowledge base than the existing dataset ( Peng et al . , 2017 ) , and , therefore , these datasets can be used to more effectively evaluate methods which predict relation labels for each individual entity tuple .
We show empirically that by jointly training lower - arity models and an nary score aggregation model , the proposed method improves the performance of n - ary relation extraction .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst attempt to apply universal schemas to n - ary relation extraction , taking advantage of the compositionality of higher - arity facts .
2 Task Deﬁnition and Notation The cross - sentence n - ary relation extraction task ( Peng et
al . , 2017 ) is deﬁned as follows .
Let Ebe a set of entities , RKBbe a set of relation types of an external knowledge base KB , and OKB = fhr;(e1;:::;en)i : r(e1;:::;en)2KB;r2 2For example , the ternary relation AwardedFor ( director;movie;award ) can be decomposed into the binary relations DirectorOf ( director;movie ) and WonAward ( director;award ) .
Note that a similar idea is introduced in ( Ernst et al . , 2018 ) as partial facts orpartial patterns .

RKB;ei2Eg be the set of facts in KB .
We collect a set of candidate entity tuples among which KB relation r2 R KBpossibly holds.4Here , all entities in each candidate tuple ( e1;:::;en ) are mentioned in the same text section Tin a given set of documents .
We deﬁne a set of these entity mentions as Otext = fhT;(e1;:::;en)i :
ei2Eis mentioned in Tg .
Here , text section T is a ( short ) span in a document which can describes relational facts among entities .
In the cross - sentence n - ary relation extraction task , text sectionTcan contain multiple sentences .
In this paper , following ( Peng et al . , 2017 ) , we deﬁne Mconsecutive sentences ( M1 ) which containntarget entities as a text section in the crosssentencen - ary relation extraction task .
We use the term “ relation ” to refer to both relations r2R KB and sections T.
The goal of the cross - sentence n - ary relation extraction task is to predict new facts hr;(e1;:::;en)i=2O KBfor relationr2R

3 Proposed Method 3.1 Lower - Arity Facts To alleviate the sparsity problem of facts among nentities ( n > 2 ) and to utilize well - studied encoders for binary and unary surface patterns
, we 4It is allowed that multiple KB relations hold among the same set of entities .
6227decompose a set of original n - ary facts , O , into a set of unary factsO1and a set of binary facts O2 ( Figure 1 ) .
Unary Facts : Given an n - ary fact hr;(e1;:::;ek)i 2 O , we decompose it into a set ofnunary factsfhr(k);eki : k= 1;:::;ng , wherer(k)is a tentative unary relation w.r.t .
the k - th argument of the original relation r. Ifris a KB relation , we deﬁne unary relation r(k)as a new canonicalized relation .
If ris sectionT , we deﬁne unary relation r(k)as a tupler(k)= ( T;pos ( ek ) ) , wherepos(ek)is a set of word position indices of entityekin sectionT(Figure 2 ) .
We denote a set of all decomposed unary facts by O1 .
Intuitively , these unary relations represent semantic roles or types of corresponding arguments of the original relationr(Yao et al . , 2013 ) .
Binary Facts : Given an n - ary fact hr;(e1;:::;ek)i 2 O , we decompose it into a set of n(n 1)binary facts fhr(k;l);(ek;el)i :
k;l = 1;:::;n;k6 = lg , wherer(k;l)is a tentative binary relation between thek - th andl - th argument of the original relation r. Ifris a KB relation , we deﬁne binary relation r(k;l)as a new canonicalized relation .
If ris a sectionT , we represent it by the shortest path betweenekandelon the document graph ( Quirk and Poon , 2017 ) of T(Figure 2 ) , and denote it bypath(T;ek;el ) .
We denote the set of all decomposed binary facts by O2 .
3.2 Lower - Arity Relation Representations We learn a vector representation v(r)2Rdrfor each unary or binary relation in O1orO2 .
For r(k)orr(k;l)derived from a KB relation , we represent it by a trainable parameter vector .
On the other hand , for the one derived from a textual relation , we use the following encoders to compute its representations .
Unary encoder : For an unary textual relation r(k)= ( T;pos ( ek ) ) , we represent each section Tby a sequence of word vectors and use a bidirectional LSTM ( Bi - LSTM )
( Schuster and Paliwal , 1997 ) to compute a hidden representation hl2Rdrat each word position l.
Following recent works ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ; He et al . , 2018 ; Lee et al . , 2017 ) , we aggregate hlwithin a phrase of entityekto compute v(T(k ) ) .
We use elementwise mean as aggregation function : v(r(k ) )
= mean(fhl : l2pos(ek)g):(1 )
Binary encoder : For a binary textual relationr(k;l)=path(T;ek;el ) , we represent each token ( word or edge label ) in path(T;ek;el)by an embedding vector ( Toutanova et al . , 2015 ; Verga et
al . , 2016 )
.
We use a Bi - LSTM to compute a hidden representation h0 l2Rdrat each token positionl , and max - pool along the path to compute the relation representation : v(T(k;l ) )
= max(fh0 l : l= 1;:::;Lg):(2 )
3.3 Learning Relation Representations We follow Verga et al .
( 2017 ) to train relation representations ( x3.2 ) .
We deﬁne a score hr;pifor each lower - arity fact hr;pi2O 1[O 2 , and minimize the following loss ( 3 ) for each arity i= 1;2 .
Here , placeholder prefers to either an entity ( if hr;pi2O 1 ) or an entity tuple ( if hr;pi2O 2 ) , and we simply refer to both as entity tuple .
The loss functions contrast a score of an original fact hr;p+i 2 Oiand those of Ksampled negative factshr;p  ki=2Oi .
We sample negative facts by randomly replacing entity tuple p+in the original fact by different entity tuples p 
k.
Li = E hr;p+i2Oi hr;p  ki=2Oi[ log(exp(hr;p+i ) exp(hr;p+i)+P kexp(hr;p  ki ) ) ] : ( 3 ) The score of fact hr;piis deﬁned as hr;pi= v(r)Tv(p;r ) .
Entity tuple representations v(p;r ) are computed with a weighted average of the representationsfv(r0 ) :
r02V(p)gas shown in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) where a(r0;r;V(p))is the attention weight for each relation r02V(p).5 v(p;r )
= X r02V(p)a(r0;r;V(p))v(r0 ) ; a(r0;r;V(p ) )
= exp(v(r0)Tv(r))P r002V(p)exp(v(r00)Tv(r)):(4 ) V(p ) =(
fr : hr;eki2O 1 g ( ifp = ek ) fr :
hr;(ek;el)i2O 2g(ifp= ( ek;el)):(5 ) 3.4 Aggregating Lower - Arity Scores To predictn - ary facts of KB relation r2R KB , we compute its score hr;(e1;:::;en)iby aggregating lower - arity scores as in ( 6 ) , where w( ) ris a positive scalar weight deﬁned for each KB relation which sum to one :P kw(k ) r+P k6 = lw(k;l ) r=
1 . 5During training , as in ( Verga et al . , 2017 ) , we aggregate sub - sampled Mrelations from V(p)ifjV(p)j > M .
We set M= 2for all experiments .
6228We can set all weights w(k ) randw(k;l ) rto1 = n2 , or train these weights to give higher scores to positiven - ary facts by minimizing additional loss functionLn .
Note thatLndirectly contrasts n - ary scores associated with
KB relations r2R KBin a more supervised manner than both L1andL2.6 hr;(e1;:::;en)i= nX k=1w(k ) rhr(k);eki+X k=1;:::;n l=1;:::;n k6 = lw(k;l ) rhr(k;l);(ek;el)i : ( 6 ) Ln=
E hr;p+i2O KB hr;p i=2O KB[max(0;1 hr;p+i+hr;p i ) ] ( 7 ) The overall loss function is now L = L1+L2 +  Ln .
By changing  , we can balance the semisupervised effect of lower - arity universal schemas ( L1;L2 ) and that of the supervision with n - ary relation labels ( Ln ) .
4 Experiments 4.1 Dataset The cross - sentence n - ary relation extraction dataset from Peng et
al .
( 2017 ) contains only 59 distinct ternary KB facts including the train and test set .
Since our proposed method and universal schemas baselines predict KB relations for each entity tuple instead of each surface pattern , the number of known facts of KB relations is crucial to reliably evaluate and compare these methods .
Thus , we created two new n - ary cross - sentence relation extraction datasets ( dubbed with Wiki-90k andWF-20k ) that contain more known facts retrieved from public knowledge bases .
To create the Wiki-90k and WF-20k datasets , we used Wikidata and Freebase respectively as external knowledge bases .
Since these knowledge bases store only binary relational facts , we deﬁned multiple ternary relations by combining a few binary relations.7;8For both datasets , we collected paragraphs from the English Wikipedia , and used Stanford CoreNLP ( Manning et al . , 2014 ) to 6The loss function ( 7 ) performs better than a loglikelihood based loss ,  log(hr;p+i hr;p i ) .
7See the appendix A for details about deﬁned ternary relations .
8For about half of the deﬁned ternary relations , combined original binary relations in KB are different from decomposed binary relations of the ternary relations in the proposed method ( x3.1).extract dependency and co - reference links .
Entity mentions are detected using DBpedia Spotlight ( Daiber et al . , 2013 ) .
We followed ( Peng et al . , 2017 ) to extract co - occurring entity tuples and their surface patterns , that is , we selected tuples which occurred in a minimal span within at mostM3consecutive sentences .
Entity tuples without a known KB relation are subsampled , since the number of such tuples are too large .
We randomly partitioned all entity tuples into train , development ( dev ) , and test sets .
4.2 Baselines ( Song et al . , 2018 ): The state - of - the - art crosssentencen - ary relation extraction method proposed by Song et al .
( 2018 ) represents each surface pattern by the concatenation of entity vectors from the last layer of a Graph State LSTM , a variant of a graph neural network .
The concatenated vector is then fed into a classiﬁer to predict the relation label .
Since their method directly predicts a relation label for each surface pattern , it is more robust to the sparsity of surface patterns among a speciﬁc higher arity entity tuple .
However , due to their purely supervised training objective , its performance may degrade if the number of available training labels is small .
Universal schemas : We compared our method with semi - supervised methods based on universal schemas ( Toutanova et al . , 2015 ; Verga et al . , 2017 ) .
In our experiments , we used the same encoder as ( Song et al . , 2018 ) to encode each surface pattern.9We tested two types of scoring functions , Model F and Model E , as in ( Toutanova et al . , 2015).10;11 4.3 Evaluation We compared the methods in the held - out evaluation as in ( Mintz et al . , 2009 ) and report ( weighted ) mean average precision ( MAP ) ( Riedel et al . , 2013 ) .
Unless otherwise noted , reported values are average values over six experiments , in which network parameters are randomly initialized .
All reported p - values are calculated based on Wilcoxon rank sum test ( Wilcoxon , 1945 ) with 9Using linear projection instead of simple concatenation did not improve performance in our preliminary experiments .
10It is not trivial to apply Model E scoring function with Verga et
al .
( 2017 ) method , since their aggregation method calculates a representation for each row , i.e. entity tuple .
11DistMult scoring function in ( Toutanova et al . , 2015 ) showed poor performance compared to the other two scoring functions in our preliminary experiments .

In the result , U+B performs signiﬁcantly better ( p < 0:005 ) than U andB , and this shows effectiveness of combining scores of both binary facts and unary facts .
On the other hand , there was no signiﬁcant difference between U+B+N andN(p > 0:9 ) .
Note that we used all positive labels in this experiment , that is , sufﬁcient amount of positive labels are used for calculating the loss N. Data efﬁciency : Furthermore , we also investigated the inﬂuence of the training data size ( the number of positive labels ) of our proposed method and baseline methods.13Here , 
= 1stands for optimizingLninstead ofL1+L2 +  Ln .
As shown in Figure 3 ,  = 1 achieved higher performance than  = 1 , showing that introducing lower - arity semi - supervised loss ( L1+L2 ) improves the performance for dataset with few positive labels .
On the other hand , the lower performance of  = 0compared to  = 0:1;1suggests that information of higher - arity facts introduced fromLnis beneﬁtial for n - ary relation extraction .

ary facts into dense unary and binary facts .
Experiments on two datasets with multiple ternary relations show that our proposed method can statistically signiﬁcantly improve over previous works , which suggests the effectiveness of using unary and binary interaction among entities in surface patterns .
However , as Fatemi et al . ( 2019 ) suggests , there exists cases in which reconstructing n - ary facts from decomposed binary facts induces false positives .
Tackling this issue is one important future research direction .
