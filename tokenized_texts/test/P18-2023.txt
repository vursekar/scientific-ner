Abstract
Analogical reasoning is effective in capturing linguistic regularities .
This paper proposes an analogical reasoning task on Chinese .
After delving into Chinese lexical knowledge , we sketch 68 implicit morphological relations and 28 explicit semantic relations .
A big and balanced dataset CA8 is then built for this task , including 17813 questions .
Furthermore , we systematically explore the inﬂuences of vector representations , context features , and corpora on analogical reasoning .
With the experiments , CA8 is proved to be a reliable benchmark for evaluating Chinese word embeddings .

Introduction
Recently , the boom of word embedding draws our attention to analogical reasoning on linguistic regularities .
Given the word representations , analogy questions can be automatically solved via vector computation , e.g. “ apples - apple + car ≈ cars ” for morphological regularities and “ king man + woman ≈ queen ” for semantic regularities ( Mikolov et al , 2013 ) .
Analogical reasoning has become a reliable evaluation method for word embeddings .
In addition , It can be used in inducing morphological transformations ( Soricut and Och , 2015 ) , detecting semantic relations ( Herdagdelen and Baroni , 2009 ) , and translating unknown words ( Langlais and Patry , 2007 ) .
It is well known that linguistic regularities vary a lot among different languages .
For example , Chinese is a typical analytic language which lacks inﬂection .
Figure 1 shows that function words and reduplication are used to denote grammatical and semantic information .
In addition , many semantic

relations are closely related with social and culin Chinese “ sh¯ı - xi¯an ” ( god of tural factors , e.g. poetry ) refers to the poet Li - bai and “ sh¯ı - shèng ” ( saint of poetry ) refers to the poet Du - fu .
However ,
few attempts have been made in Chinese analogical reasoning .
The only Chinese analogy dataset is translated from part of an English dataset ( Chen et al , 2015 ) ( denote as CA_translated ) .
Although it has been widely used in evaluation of word embeddings ( Yang and Sun , 2015 ;
Yin et
al , 2016 ; Su and Lee , 2017 ) , it could not serve as a reliable benchmark since it includes only 134 unique Chinese words in three semantic relations ( capital , state , and family ) , and morphological knowledge is not even considered .
Therefore , we would like to investigate linguistic regularities beneath Chinese .
By modeling them as an analogical reasoning task , we could further examine the effects of vector offset methods in detecting Chinese morphological and semantic relations .
As far as we know , this is the ﬁrst study focusing on Chinese analogical reasoning .
Moreover , we release a standard benchmark for evaluation of Chinese word embedding , together with 36 open - source pre - trained embeddings at

2.2 Semi - afﬁxation
2 Morphological Relations
Morphology concerns the internal structure of words .
There is a common belief that Chinese is a morphologically impoverished language since a morpheme mostly corresponds to an orthographic character , and it lacks apparent distinctions between roots and afﬁxes .
However , Packard ( 2000 ) suggests that Chinese has a different morphological system because it selects different “ settings ” on parameters shared by all languages .
We will clarify this special system by mapping its morphological analogies into two processes : reduplication and semi - afﬁxation .
2.1 Reduplication
Reduplication means a morpheme is repeated to form a new word , which is semantically and/or syntactically distinct from the original morpheme , e.g. the word “ ti¯an - ti¯an”(day day ) in Figure 1(b ) means “ everyday ” .
By analyzing all the word categories in Chinese , we ﬁnd that nouns , verbs , adjectives , adverbs , and measure words have reduplication abilities .
Given distinct morphemes A and B , we summarize 6 repetition patterns in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 : Reduplication patterns of A and A - B.
Each pattern may have one or more morphological functions .
Taking Pattern 1 ( A→AA ) as an example , noun morphemes could form kinship terms or yield every / each meaning .
For verbs , it signals doing something a little bit or things happen brieﬂy .
AA reduplication could also intensify an adjective or transform it to an adverb .
• bà(dad ) → bà - bà(dad ) • ti¯an(day )
→ ti¯an - ti¯an(everyday ) • shu¯o(say ) → shu¯o - shuo(say a little ) • kàn(look ) → kàn - kàn(have a brief look )
• dà(big ) → dà - dà(very big ; greatly ) • sh¯en(deep ) → sh¯en - sh¯en(deeply )

Afﬁxation is a morphological process whereby a bound morpheme ( an afﬁx ) is attached to roots or stems to form new language units .
Chinese is a typical isolating language that has few afﬁxes .
Liu et al ( 2001 ) points out that although afﬁxes are rare in Chinese , there are some components behaving like afﬁxes and can also be used as independent lexemes .
They are called semi - afﬁxes .
To model the semi - afﬁxation process , we uncover 21 semi - preﬁxes and 41 semi - sufﬁxes .
These semi - sufﬁxes can be used to denote changes of meaning or part of speech .
For example , the semi - preﬁx “ dì- ” could be added to numerals to form ordinal numbers , and the semi - sufﬁx “ -zi ” is able to nominalize an adjective :
• y¯ı(one ) → dì - y¯ı(ﬁrst )
èr(two ) → dì - èr(second )
• pàng(fat ) → pàng - zi(a fat man )
shòu(thin ) → shòu - zi(a thin man )
3 Semantic Relations
To investigate semantic knowledge reasoning , we present 28 semantic relations in four aspects : geography , history , nature , and people .
Among them we inherit a few relations from English datasets , e.g. country - capital and family members , while the rest of them are proposed originally on the basis of our observation of Chinese lexical knowledge .
For example , a Chinese province may have its own abbreviation , capital city , and representative drama , which could form rich semantic analogies :
• ¯an - hu¯ı vs zhè - ji¯ang ( province ) • wˇan vs zhè ( abbreviation ) • hé - féi vs háng - zh¯ou ( capital ) • huáng - méi - xì vs yuè - jù ( drama )
We also address novel relations that could be used for other languages , e.g. scientists and their ﬁndings , companies and their founders .
4 Task of Chinese Analogical Reasoning
Analogical reasoning task is to retrieve the answer of the question “ a is to b as c is to ? ” .
Based on the relations discussed above , we ﬁrstly collect word pairs for each relation .
Since there are no explicit word boundaries in Chinese , we take dictionaries and word segmentation speciﬁcations as references to conﬁrm the inclusion of each word

pair .
To avoid the imbalance problem addressed in English benchmarks ( Gladkova et al , 2016 ) , we set a limit of 50 word pairs at most for each relation .
In this step , 1852 unique Chinese word pairs are retrieved .
We then build CA8 , a big , balanced dataset for Chinese analogical reasoning including 17813 questions .
Compared with CA_translated ( Chen et al , 2015 ) , CA8 incorporates both morphological and semantic questions , and it brings in much more words , relation types and questions .
Table 1 shows details of the two datasets .
They are both used for evaluation in Experiments section .
5 Experiments
In Chinese analogical reasoning task , we aim at investigating to what extent word vectors capture the linguistic relations , and how it is affected by three important factors : vector representations ( sparse and dense ) , context features ( character , word , and ngram ) , and training corpora ( size and domain ) .
Table 2 shows the hyper - parameters used in this work .
All the text data used in our experiments ( as shown in Table 3 ) are preprocessed via the following steps :
• Remove the html and xml tags from the texts and set the encoding as utf-8 .
Digits and punctuations are remained .
• Convert traditional Chinese characters into simpliﬁed characters with Open Chinese Convert ( OpenCC)2 .
• Conduct Chinese word segmentation with
HanLP(v_1.5.3)3 .
5.1 Vector Representations
Existing vector representations fall into two types , dense vectors and sparse vectors .
SGNS ( skipgram model with negative sampling ) ( Mikolov et al , 2013 ) and PPMI ( Positive Pointwise Mutual Information ) ( Levy and Goldberg , 2014a ) are respectively typical methods for learning dense and sparse word vectors .
Table 4 lists the performance of them on CA_translated and CA8 datasets under different conﬁgurations .
We can observe that on CA8 dataset , SGNS representations perform better in analogical reasoning of morphological relations and PPMI representations show great advantages in semantic is consistent with perrelations .

probably because the reasoning on morphological relations relies more on common words in context , and the training procedure of SGNS favors frequent word pairs .
Meanwhile , PPMI model is more sensitive to infrequent and speciﬁc word pairs , which are beneﬁcial to semantic relations .
The above observation shows that CA8 is a reliable benchmark for studying the effects of dense and sparse vectors .
Compared with CA_translated and existing English analogy datasets , it offers both morphological and semantic questions which are also balanced across different types 4 .
5.2 Context Features
To investigate the inﬂuence of context features on analogical reasoning , we consider not only word features , but also ngram features inspired by statistical language models , and character ( Hanzi ) features based on the close relationship between Chinese words and their composing characters 5 .
Speciﬁcally , we use word bigrams for ngram features , character unigrams and bigrams for character features .
4CA_translated and SemEval datasets contain only semantic questions , MSR dataset contains only morphological questions , and in Google dataset the capital : country relation constitutes 56.72 % of all semantic questions .
5The SGNS with word and character features are implemented by fasttext toolkit , the rest are implemented by ngram2vec toolkit .
Ngrams and Chinese characters are effective features in training word representations ( Zhao et al , 2017 ; Chen et al , 2015 ; Bojanowski et al , 2016 ) .
However , Table 4 shows that there is only a slight increase on CA_translated dataset with ngram features , and the accuracies in most cases decrease after integrating character features .
In contrast , on CA8 dataset , the introduction of ngram and character features brings signiﬁcant and consistent improvements on almost all the categories .
Furthermore , character features are especially advantageous for reasoning of morphological relations .
SGNS model integrating with character features even doubles the accuracy in morphological questions .
Besides ,
the representations achieve surprisingly high accuracies in some categories of CA_translated , which means that there is little room for further improvement .
However it is much harder for representation methods to achieve high accuracies on CA8 .
The best conﬁguration only achieves 68.0 % .
5.3 Corpora
We compare word representations learned upon corpora of different sizes and domains .
As shown in Table 3 , six corpora are used in the experiments : Chinese Wikipedia , Baidubaike , People ’s Daily News , Sogou News , Zhihu QA , and “ Com141  Wikipedia 1.2 G Baidubaike 4.3 G

bination ” which is built by combining the ﬁrst ﬁve corpora together .
Table 5 shows that accuracies increase with the growth in corpus size , e.g. Baidubaike ( an online Chinese encyclopedia ) has a clear advantage over Wikipedia .
Also , the domain of a corpus plays an important role in the experiments .
We can observe that vectors trained on news data are beneﬁcial to geography relations , especially on People ’s Daily which has a focus on political news .
Another example is Zhihu QA , an online questionanswering corpus which contains more informal data than others .
It is helpful to reduplication relations since many reduplication words appear frequently in spoken language .
With the largest size and varied domains , “ Combination ” corpus performs much better than others in both morphological and semantic relations .
Based on the above experiments , we ﬁnd that vector representations , context features , and corpora all have important inﬂuences on Chinese analogical reasoning .
Also , CA8 is proved to be a reliable benchmark for evaluation of Chinese word embeddings .
6 Conclusion
In this paper , we investigate the linguistic regularities beneath Chinese , and propose a Chinese analogical reasoning task based on 68 morphological relations and 28 semantic relations .
In the experiments , we apply vector offset method to this task , and examine the effects of vector representations , context features , and corpora .
This study offers an interesting perspective combining linguistic analysis and representation models .
The benchmark and embedding sets we release could also serve as a solid basis for Chinese NLP tasks .
