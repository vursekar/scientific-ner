Abstract Due to its potential applications , open - domain dialogue generation has become popular and achieved remarkable progress in recent years , but sometimes suffers from generic responses .
Previous models are generally trained based on 1 - to-1 mapping from an input query to its response , which actually ignores the nature of 1 - to - n mapping in dialogue that there may exist multiple valid responses corresponding to the same query .
In this paper , we propose to utilize the multiple references by considering the correlation of different valid responses and modeling the 1 - to - n mapping with a novel two - step generation architecture .
The ﬁrst generation phase extracts the common features of different responses which , combined with distinctive features obtained in the second phase , can generate multiple diverse and appropriate responses .
Experimental results show that our proposed model can effectively improve the quality of response and outperform existing neural dialogue models on both automatic and human evaluations .
1 Introduction In recent years , open - domain dialogue generation has become a research hotspot in Natural Language Processing due to its broad application prospect , including chatbots , virtual personal assistants , etc .
Though plenty of systems have been proposed to improve the quality of generated responses from various aspects such as topic ( Xing et al . , 2017 ) , persona modeling ( Zhang et al . , 2018b ) and emotion controlling ( Zhou et al . , 2018b ) , most of these recent approaches are primarily built upon the sequence - to - sequence architecture ( Cho et al . , 2014 ; Shang et al . , 2015 ) which suffers from the “ safe ” response problem ( Li et al . , 2016a ; Sato et al . , 2017 ) .
This can be ascribed to modeling the response generation process as 1to-1 mapping , which ignores the nature of 1 - toCorresponding author : Rui Yan ( ruiyan@pku.edu.cn ) Figure 1 : An illustration of the two - step generation architecture .
Different from the conventional methods ( shown in green color ) which model each response from scratch every time , our method ﬁrst builds a common feature of multiple responses and models each response based on it afterward .
n mapping of dialogue that multiple possible responses can correspond to the same query .
To deal with the generic response problem , various methods have been proposed , including diversity - promoting objective function ( Li et al . , 2016a ) , enhanced beam search ( Shao et al . , 2016 ) , latent dialogue mechanism ( Zhou et
al . , 2017 , 2018a ) , Variational Autoencoders ( V AEs ) based models ( Zhao et al . , 2017 ; Serban et al . , 2017 ) , etc .
However , these methods still view multiple responses as independent ones and fail to model multiple responses jointly .
Recently , Zhang et al .
( 2018a ) introduce a maximum likelihood strategy that given an input query , the most likely response is approximated rather than all possible responses , which is further implemented by Rajendran et al .
( 2018 ) with reinforcement learning for task - oriented dialogue .
Although capable of generating the most likely response , these methods fail to model other possible responses and ignore the correlation of different responses .
In this paper , we propose a novel response generation model for open - domain conversation , which learns to generate multiple diverse responses with multiple references by considering
3827the correlation of different responses .
Our motivation lies in two aspects : 1 ) multiple responses for a query are likely correlated , which can facilitate building the dialogue system .
2 ) it is easier to model each response based on other responses than from scratch every time .
As shown in Figure 1 , given an input query , different responses may share some common features e.g. positive attitudes or something else , but vary in discourses or expressions which we refer to as distinct features .
Accordingly , the system can beneﬁt from modeling these features respectively rather than learning each query - response mapping from scratch .
Inspired by this idea , we propose a two - step dialogue generation architecture as follows .
We jointly view the multiple possible responses to the same query as a response bag .
In the ﬁrst generation phase , the common feature of different valid responses is extracted , serving as a base from which each speciﬁc response in the bag is further approximated .
The system then , in the second generation phase , learns to model the distinctive feature of each individual response which , combined with the common feature , can generate multiple diverse responses simultaneously .
Experimental results show that our method can outperform existing competitive neural models under both automatic and human evaluation metrics , which demonstrates the effectiveness of the overall approach .
We also provide ablation analyses to validate each component of our model .
To summarize , our contributions are threefold : We propose to model multiple responses to a query jointly by considering the correlations of responses with multi - reference learning .
We consider the common and distinctive features of the response bag and propose a novel two - step dialogue generation architecture .
Experiments show that the proposed method can generate multiple diverse responses and outperform existing competitive models on both automatic and human evaluations .
2 Related Work Along with the ﬂourishing development of neural networks , the sequence - to - sequence framework has been widely used for conversation response generation ( Shang et al . , 2015 ; Sordoni et al . ,2015 ) where the mapping from a query xto a replyyis learned with the negative log likelihood .
However , these models suffer from the “ safe ” response problem .
To address this problem , various methods have been proposed .
Li et al .
( 2016a ) propose a diversity - promoting objective function to encourage diverse responses during decoding .
Zhou
et
al .
( 2017 , 2018a ) introduce a responding mechanism between the encoder and decoder to generate various responses .
Xing et
al .
( 2017 ) incorporate topic information to generate informative responses .
However , these models suffer from the deterministic structure when generating multiple diverse responses .
Besides , during the training of these models , response utterances are only used in the loss function and ignored when forward computing , which can confuse the model for pursuing multiple objectives simultaneously .
A few works explore to change the deterministic structure of sequence - to - sequence models by introducing stochastic latent variables .
V AE is one of the most popular methods ( Bowman et al . , 2016 ; Zhao et
al . , 2017 ; Serban et al . , 2017 ; Cao and Clark , 2017 ) , where the discourse - level diversity is modeled by a Gaussian distribution
.
However , it is observed that in the CV AE with a ﬁxed Gaussian prior , the learned conditional posteriors tend to collapse to a single mode , resulting in a relatively simple scope ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) .
To tackle this , WAE ( Gu et al . , 2018 ) which adopts a Gaussian mixture prior network with Wasserstein distance and V AD ( Du et al . , 2018 ) which sequentially introduces a series of latent variables to condition each word in the response sequence are proposed .
Although these models overcome the deterministic structure of sequence - to - sequence model , they still ignore the correlation of multiple valid responses and each case is trained separately .
To consider the multiple responses jointly , the maximum likelihood strategy is explored .
Zhang et al .
( 2018a ) propose the maximum generated likelihood criteria which model a query with its multiple responses as a bag of instances and proposes to optimize the model towards the most likely answer rather than all possible responses .
Similarly , Rajendran et al .
( 2018 ) propose to reward the dialogue system if any valid answer is produced in the reinforcement learning phase .
Though considering multiple responses jointly , the maximum likelihood strategy fails to utilize all the references during training with some cases ig-

Given an input query x , the model aims to approximate the multiple responses in a bag fygsimultaneously with the continuous common and distinctive features , i.e. , the latent variables candzobtained from the two generation phases respectively .
nored .
In our approach , we consider multiple responses jointly and model each speciﬁc response separately by a two - step generation architecture .
3 Approach In this paper , we propose a novel response generation model for short - text conversation , which models multiple valid responses for a given query jointly .
We posit that a dialogue system can beneﬁt from multi - reference learning by considering the correlation of multiple responses .
Figure 2 demonstrates the whole architecture of our model .
We now describe the details as follows .
3.1 Problem Formulation and Model Overview Training samplesf(x;fyg)igi = N i=1consist of each query xand the set of its valid responses fyg , whereNdenotes the number of training samples .
For a dialogue generation model , it aims to map from the input query xto
the output response y2fyg .
To achieve this , different from conventional methods which view the multiple responses as independent ones , we propose to consider the correlation of multiple responses with a novel twostep generation architecture , where the response bagfygand each response y2 fygare modeled by two separate features which are obtained in each generation phase respectively .
Speciﬁcally , we assume a variable c2Rnrepresenting the common feature of different responses and an unobserved latent variable z2Zcorresponding to the distinct feature for each yin the bag .
The com - mon feature cis generated in the ﬁrst stage given xand the distinctive feature zis sampled from the latent space Zin the second stage given the query xand common feature c.
The ﬁnal responses are then generated conditioned on both the common feature cand distinct feature zsimultaneously .
3.2 Common Feature of the Response Bag In the ﬁrst generation step , we aim to map from the input query xto
the common feature cof the response bagfyg .
Inspired by multi - instance learning ( Zhou , 2004 ) , we start from the simple intuition that it is much easier for the model to ﬁt multiple instances from their mid - point than a random start - point , as illustrated in Figure 1 .
To obtain this , we model the common feature of the response bag as the mid - point of embeddings of multiple responses .
In practice , we ﬁrst encode the input xwith a bidirectional gated recurrent units ( GRU ) ( Cho et al . , 2014 ) to obtain an input representation hx .
Then , the common featurecis computed by a mapping network which is implemented by a feed - forward neural network whose trainable parameter is denoted as .
The feature cis then fed into the response decoder to obtain the intermediate response ycwhich is considered to approximate all valid responses .
Mathematically , the objective function is deﬁned as : Lavg=1 jfygjX y2fyglogp ( yjc ) ( 1 ) wherejfygjis the cardinality of the response bag fygandp represents the response decoder .
3829 Figure 3 : The sentence embedding function of the discriminator in the ﬁrst generation phase .
Besides , to measure how well the intermediate response ycapproximates the mid - point response , we set up an individual discriminator and derive the mapping function to produce better results .
As to the discriminator , we ﬁrst project each utterance to an embedding space with ﬁxed dimensionality via convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) with different kernels as the process shown in Figure 3 .
Then , the cosine similarity of the query and response embeddings is computed , denoted as D0(x;y ) , where0represents trainable parameter in the discriminator .
For the response bag fyg , the average response embedding is used to compute the matching score .
The objective of intermediate response ycis then to minimize the difference betweenD0(x;yc)andD0(x;fyg ): Ldisc = Ex;fyg;yc[D0(x;yc) D0(x;fyg)](2 ) where ycdenotes the utterance produced by the decoder conditioned on the variable c. To overcome the discrete and non - differentiable problem , which breaks down gradient propagation from the discriminator , we adopt a “ soft ” continuous approximation ( Hu et al . , 2017 ): ^yctsoftmax ( ot=  ) ( 3 ) where otis the logit vector as the inputs to the softmax function at time - step tand the temperature  is set to  ! 0as training proceeds for increasingly peaked distributions .
The whole loss for the step - one generation is then Lfirst = Lavg+Ldisc ( 4 ) which is optimized by a minimax game with adversarial training ( Goodfellow et
al . , 2014 ) .
3.3 Response Speciﬁc Generation
The second generation phase aims to model each speciﬁc response in a response bag respectively .
Inpractice , we adopt the CV AE ( Sohn et al . , 2015 ; Yan et al . , 2015 ) architecture , while two prominent modiﬁcations remain .
Firstly , rather than modeling each response with the latent variable zfrom scratch , our model approximates each response based on the bag representation cwith only the distinctive feature of each speciﬁc response remaining to be captured .
Secondly , the prior common feature ccan provide extra information for the sampling network which is supposed to decrease the latent searching space .
Speciﬁcally , similar to the CV AE architecture , the overall objective for our model in the second generation phase is as below :
Lcvae = Eq  ( zjx;y;c)p(cjx)[logp ( yjc;z ) ]  D[q  ( zjx;y;c)jjp'(zjx;c)](5 ) whereq  represents the recognition network and p'is the prior network with  and'as the trainable parameters;D(jj)is the regularization term which measures the distance between the two distributions .
In practice , the recognition networks are implemented with a feed - forward network that  log  2 = Wq2 4hx hy c3 5+bq ( 6 ) where hxandhyare the utterance representations of query and response got by GRU respectively , and the latent variable z N ( ;2I ) .
For the prior networks , we consider two kinds of implements .
One is the vanilla CV AE model ( Zhao et al . , 2017 ) where the prior p'(zjx;c)is modeled by a another feed - forward network conditioned on the representations hxandcas follows , " 0 log 02 # = Wphx c + bp ( 7 ) and the distanceD(jj)here is measured by the KL divergence .
For the other , we adopt the WAE model ( Gu et al . , 2018 ) in which the prior p'(zjx;c)is modeled by a mixture of Gaussian distributions GMM ( k;0 k;0 k2I)K k=1 , whereKis the number of Gaussian distributions and kis the mixture coefﬁcient of the k - th component of the GMM module as computed : k = exp(ek)PK i=1exp(ei)(8 )
3830and 2 4ek 0 k log02 k3 5 = Wp;khx c + bp;k ( 9 ) To sample an instance , Gumble - Softmax reparametrization trick ( Kusner and Hern ´ andezLobato , 2016 ) is utilized to normalize the coefﬁcients .
The distance here is measured by the Wasserstein distance which is implemented with an adversarial discriminator ( Zhao et al . , 2018 ) .
Recap that in the second generation phase the latent variable zis considered to only capture the distinctive feature of each speciﬁc response .
Hence to distinguish the latent variable zfor each separate response , we further introduce a multireference bag - of - word loss ( MBOW ) which requires the network to predict the current response yagainst the response bag : Lmbow = Eq  ( zjx;y;c)[logp(ybowjx;z ) + log(1 p(fygbowjx;z))](10 ) where the probability is computed by a feedforward network fas the vanilla bag - of - word loss ( Zhao et al . , 2017 ) does ; fygis the complementary response bag of yand its probability is computed as the average probability of responses in the bag ; and is a scaling factor accounting for the difference in magnitude .
As it shows , the MBOW loss penalizes the recognition networks if other complementary responses can be predicted from the distinctive variable z.
Besides , since the probability of the complementary term may approach zero which makes it difﬁcult to optimize , we actually adopt its lower bound in practice : log(1 p(ybowjx;z ) )
= log(1 jyjY t=1efyt PjVj jefj ) log(jyjY t=1(1 efyt PjVj jefj ) )
( 11 ) wherejVjis vocabulary size .
Totally , the whole loss for the step - two generation is then : Lsecond = Lcvae+Lmbow ( 12 ) which can be optimized in an end - to - end way.3.4 Optimization and Testing Our whole model can be trained in an end - to - end fashion .
To train the model , we ﬁrst pre - train the word embedding using Glove ( ( Pennington et al . , 2014))1 .
Then modules of the model are jointly trained by optimizing the losses Lfirst andLsecond of the two generation phases respectively .
To overcome the vanishing latent variable problem ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) of CV AE , we adopt the KL annealing strategy ( Bowman et al . , 2016 ) , where the weight of the KL term is gradually increased during training .
The other technique employed is the MBOW loss which is able to sharpen the distribution of latent variable zfor each speciﬁc response and alleviate the vanishing problem at the same time .
During testing , diverse responses can be obtained by the two generation phases described above , where the distinctive latent variable zcorresponding to each speciﬁc response is sampled from the prior probability network .
This process is illustrated in Figure 2 .
Capable of capturing the common feature of the response bag , the variable cis obtained from the mapping network and no intermediate utterance is required , which facilitates reducing the complexity of decoding .
4 Experimental Setup 4.1 Dataset Focusing on open - domain dialogue , we perform experiments on a large - scale single - turn conversation dataset Weibo ( Shang et al . , 2015 ) , where each input post is generally associated with multiple response utterances2 .
Concretely , the Weibo dataset consists of short - text online chit - chat dialogues in Chinese , which is crawled from Sina Weibo3 .
Totally , there are 4,423,160 queryresponse pairs for training set and 10000 pairs for the validation and testing , where there are around 200k unique query in the training set and each query used in testing correlates with four responses respectively .
For preprocessing , we follow the conventional settings ( Shang et al . , 2015 ) .
4.2 Baselines We compare our model with representative dialogue generation approaches as listed below : 1https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ 2More such multi - reference data is widely available , e.g. social media like Twitter .
But we adopt Weibo in this work since it is large and publicly available .

4.3 Evaluation Metrics To comprehensively evaluate the quality of generated response utterances , we adopt both automatic and human evaluation metrics : BLEU :
In dialogue generation , BLEU is widely used in previous studies ( Yao et al . , 2017 ; Shang et al . , 2018 ) .
Since multiple valid responses exist in this paper , we adopt multi - reference BLEU where the evaluated utterance is compared to provided multiple references simultaneously .
Distinctness :
To distinguish safe and commonplace responses , the distinctness score ( Li et al . , 2016a ) is designed to measure word - level diversity by counting the ratio of distinctive [ 1,2]-grams .
In our experiments , we adopt both Intra - Dist : the distinctness scores of multiple responses for a given query and Inter - Dist : the distinctness scores of generated responses of the whole testing set .
Embedding Similarity : Embedding - based metrics compute the cosine similarity between the sentence embedding of a ground - truth response and that of the generated one .
There are various ways to obtain the sentence - level embedding from the constituent word embeddings .
In our experiments , we apply three most commonly used strategies : Greedy matches each word of the reference with the most similar word in the evaluated sentence;Average uses the average of word embed-

Table 3 : Case study for the generated responses from the testing set of Weibo , where the Chinese utterances are translated into English for the sake of readability .
For each input query , we show four responses generated by each method and an additional intermediate utterance ( marked with underline ) for our model .
dings ; andExtreme takes the most extreme value among all words for each dimension of word embeddings in a sentence .
Since multiple references exist , for each utterance to be evaluated , we compute its score with the most similar reference .
Human Evaluation with Case Analysis : As automatic evaluation metrics lose sight of the overall quality of a response ( Tao et al . , 2018 ) , we also adopt human evaluation on 100 random samples to assess the generation quality with three independent aspects considered : relevance ( whether the reply is relevant to the query ) , diversity ( whether the reply narrates with diverse words ) and readability ( whether the utterance is grammatically formed ) .
Each property is assessed with a score from 1 ( worst ) to 5 ( best ) by three annotators .
The evaluation is conducted in a blind process with the utterance belonging unknown to the reviewers .
4.4 Implementation Details
All models are trained with the following hyperparameters : both encoder and decoder are set to one layer with GRU ( Cho et al . , 2014 ) cells , where the hidden state size of GRU is 256 ; the utterance length is limited to 50 ; the vocabulary size is 50,000 and the word embedding dimension is 256 ; the word embeddings are shared by the encoderand decoder ; all trainable parameters are initialized from a uniform distribution
[ -0.08 , 0.08 ] ; we employ the Adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) for optimization with a mini - batch size 128 and initialized learning rate 0.001 ; the gradient clipping strategy is utilized to avoid gradient explosion , where the gradient clipping value is set to be 5 .
For the latent variable , we adopt dimensional size 256 and the component number of the mixture Gaussian for prior networks in WAE is set to 5 .
As to the discriminator , we set the initialized learning rate as 0.0002 and use 128 different kernels for each kernel size inf2 , 3 , 4 g. The size of the response bag is limited to 10 where the instances inside are randomly sampled for each mini - batch .
All the models are implemented with Pytorch 0.4.14 .
5 Results and Analysis 5.1 Comparison against Baselines Table 1 shows our main experimental results , with baselines shown in the top and our models at the bottom .
The results show that our model ( Ours ) outperforms competitive baselines on various evaluation metrics .
The Seq2seq based models ( S2S , S2S - DB and MMS ) tend to generate 4https://pytorch.org
3833ﬂuent utterances and can share some overlapped words with the references , as the high BLEU-2 scores show .
However , the distinctness scores illustrate that these models fail to generate multiple diverse responses in spite of the diversitypromoting objective and responding mechanisms used .
We attribute this to that these models fail to consider multiple references for the same query , which may confuse the models and lead to a commonplace utterance .
As to the CV AE and WAE models , with the latent variable to control the discourse - level diversity , diverse responses can be obtained .
Compared against these previous methods , our model can achieve the best or second best performances on different automatic evaluation metrics where the improvements are most consistent on BLEU-1 and embedding - based metrics , which demonstrates the overall effectiveness of our proposed architecture .
In order to better study the quality of generated responses , we also report the human evaluation results in Table 2 .
As results show , although there remains a huge gap between existing methods and human performance ( the Gold ) , our model gains promising promotions over previous methods on generating appropriate responses with diverse expressions .
With both obvious superiority ( readability for S2S and diversity for CV AE ) and inferiority ( diversity for S2S and relevance for CV AE ) , the baselines show limited overall performances , in contrast to which our method can output more diverse utterances while maintaining the relevance to the input query and achieve a high overall score .
5.2 Ablation Study To better understand the effectiveness of each component in our model , we further conduct the ablation studies with results shown at the bottom of Table 1 .
Above all , to validate the effectiveness of the common feature , we remove the ﬁrst generation stage and get the Ours - First model .
As the results of BLEU and embedding - based metrics show , the system can beneﬁt from the common feature for better relevance to the query .
Moreover , pairwise comparisons Ours - Disc vs. Ours and Ours - MBOW vs. Ours validate the effects of the discriminator and modiﬁed multireference bag - of - word loss ( MBOW ) .
As results show , the discriminator facilitates extracting the common feature and yields more relevant responses to the input query afterward .
The MBOW Figure 4 : The statistics of distances between the input query / intermediate utterance and gold references / generated responses , where the distance is measured by the cosine similarity of sentence embeddings .
loss , similar to the effects of BOW loss in the CV AE , can lead to a more unique latent variable for each response and improve the ﬁnal distinctness scores of generated utterances .
In the experiments , we also observed the KL vanishing problem when training our model and we overcame it with the KL weight annealing strategy and the MBOW loss described above .
5.3 Case Study and Discussion Table 3 illustrates two examples of generated replies to the input query got from the testing set .
Comparing the CV AE and Ours , we can ﬁnd that although the CV AE model can generate diverse utterances , its responses tend to be irrelevant to the query and sometimes not grammatically formed , e.g. the words “ glowworm ” and “ robot ” in the sentences .
In contrast , responses generated by our model show better quality , achieving both high relevance and diversity .
This demonstrates the ability of the two - step generation architecture .
For better insight into the procedure , we present the intermediately generated utterances which show that the feature extracted in the ﬁrst stage can focus on some common and key aspects of the query and its possible responses , such as the “ amazing ” and “ software ” .
With the distinctive features sampled in the second generation phase , the model further revises the response and outputs multiple responses with diverse contents and expressions .
Recap that the common feature is expected to capture the correlations of different responses and serve as the base of a response bag from which different responses are further generated , as shown
3834 in Figure 1 .
To investigate the actual performances achieved by our model , we compute the distance between the input query / intermediate utterance and gold references / generated responses and present the results in Figure 4 .
As shown , intermediate utterances obtained in the ﬁrst generation phase tend to approximate multiple responses with similar distances at the same time .
Comparing the generated responses and the references , we ﬁnd that generated responses show both high relevant and irrelevant ratios , as the values near 0.00 and 1.00 show .
This actually agrees well with our observation that the model may sometimes rely heavily on or ignore the prior common feature information .
From a further comparison between the input query and the mid , we also observe that the intermediate utterance is more similar to ﬁnal responses than the input query , which correlates well with our original intention shown in Figure 1 . 6 Conclusion and future work In this paper , we tackle the one - to - many queryresponse mapping problem in open - domain conversation and propose a novel two - step generation architecture with the correlation of multiple valid responses considered .
Jointly viewing the multiple responses as a response bag , the model extracts the common and distinct features of different responses in two generation phases respectively to output multiple diverse responses .
Experimental results illustrate the superior performance of the proposed model in generating diverse and appropriate responses compared to previous representative approaches .
However , the modeling of the common and distinct features of responses in our method is currently implicit and coarse - grained .
Directions of future work may be pursuing betterdeﬁned features and easier training strategies .
