Abstract
Parallel texts of Japanese and a non - pro - drop language have the potential of improving the performance of Japanese zero anaphora resolution ( ZAR ) because pronouns dropped in the former are usually mentioned explicitly in the latter .
However , rule - based cross - lingual transfer is hampered by error propagation in an NLP pipeline and the frequent lack of transparency in translation correspondences .
In this paper , we propose implicit transfer by injecting machine translation ( MT ) as an intermediate task between pretraining and ZAR .
We employ a pretrained BERT model to initialize the encoder part of the encoder - decoder model for MT , and eject the encoder part for ﬁnetuning on ZAR .
The proposed framework empirically demonstrates that ZAR performance can be improved by transfer learning from MT .
In addition , we ﬁnd that the incorporation of the masked language model training into MT leads to further gains .

Introduction
Figuring out who did what to whom is an essential part of natural language understanding .
This is , however , especially challenging for so - called prodrop languages like Japanese and Chinese because they usually omit pronouns that are inferable from context .
The task of identifying the referent of such a dropped element , as illustrated in Figure 1(a ) , is referred to as zero anaphora resolution ( ZAR ) .
Although Japanese ZAR saw a performance boost with the introduction of BERT ( Ueda et al , 2020 ; Konno et al , 2020 ) , there is still a good amount of room for improvement .
A major barrier to improvement is the scarcity of training data .
The number of annotated sentences is the order of tens of thousands or less ( Kawahara et al , 2002 ; Hangyo et al , 2012 ; Iida et al , 2017 ) , and the considerable linguistic expertise required for annotation makes drastic corpus expansion impractical .
Previous attempts to overcome this limitation exploit orders - of - magnitude larger parallel texts of Japanese and English , a non - pro - drop language ( Nakaiwa , 1999 ; Furukawa et al , 2017 ) .
The key idea is that Japanese zero pronouns can be recovered from parallel texts because they are usually mentioned explicitly in English , as in Figure 1(b ) .
If translation correspondences are identiﬁed and the anaphoric relation in English is identiﬁed , then we can identify the antecedent of the omitted argument in Japanese .
Their
from English to Japanese had met with limited success , however .
It is prone to error propagation due to its dependence on word alignment , parsing , and English coreference resolution .
More importantly , the great linguistic differences between the two language often lead to parallel sentences without transparent syntactic correspondences ( Figure 1(c ) ) .
rule - based transfer
In this paper , we propose neural transfer learning from machine translation ( MT ) .
By generating English translations , a neural MT model should be able to implicitly recover omitted Japanese pronouns , thanks to its expressiveness and large training data .
We expect the knowledge gained during MT training to be transferred to ZAR .
Given that state - of - the - art ZAR models are based on BERT ( Ueda et al , 2020 ; Konno et al , 2020 , 2021 ) , it is a natural choice to explore intermediate task transfer learning ( Phang et al , 2018 ; Wang et al , 2019a ; Pruksachatkun et al , 2020 ;
Vu et al , 2020 ):
A pretrained BERT model is ﬁrst trained on MT and the resultant model is then ﬁne - tuned on
ZAR.1
A key challenge to this approach is a mismatch in model architectures .
While BERT is an encoder , the dominant paradigm of neural MT is the encoder - decoder .
Although both share Transformer ( Vaswani et al , 2017 ) as the building block ,
1In our preliminary experiments , we tested encoderdecoder pretrained models with no success .
We brieﬂy revisit this in Section 4.7 .

Because Japanese generally avoids having inanimate agents with animate patients , the English inanimate - subject sentence corresponds to two animate - subject clauses in Japanese , with two exophoric references to the reader ( i.e. , you ) .
it is non - trivial to combine the two distinct architectures , with the goal to help the former .
We use a pretrained BERT model to initialize the encoder part of the encoder - decoder model for MT .
While this technique was previously used by Imamura and Sumita ( 2019 ) and Clinchant et al ( 2019 ) , they both aimed at improving MT performance .
We show that by ejecting the encoder part for use in ﬁne - tuning ( Figure 2 ) , we can achieve performance improvements in ZAR .
We also demonstrate further improvements can be brought by incorporating encoder - side masked language model ( MLM ) training into the intermediate training on MT .
2 Related Work
2.1 Zero Anaphora Resolution ( ZAR )
ZAR has been extensively studied in major East Asian languages , Chinese and Korean as well as Japanese , which not only omit contextually inferable pronouns but also show no verbal agreement for person , number , or gender ( Park et al , 2015 ;
Yin et al , 2017 ; Song et al , 2020 ; Kim et al , 2021 ) .
While supervised learning is the standard approach to ZAR ( Iida et al , 2016 ; Ouchi et al , 2017 ; Shibata and Kurohashi , 2018 ) , training data are so small that additional resources are clearly needed .
Early studies work on case frame construction from a large raw corpus ( Sasano et al , 2008 ; Sasano and Kurohashi , 2011 ; Yamashiro et al , 2018 ) , pseudo training data generation ( Liu et al , 2017 ) , and adversarial training ( Kurita et al , 2018 ) .
These efforts are , however , overshadowed by the surprising effectiveness of BERT ’s pretraining ( Ueda et al , 2020 ; Konno et al , 2020 ) .
Adopting BERT , recent studies seek gains through multi - task learning ( Ueda et al , 2020 ) ,
data augmentation ( Konno et al , 2020 ) , and an intermediate task tailored to ZAR ( Konno et al , 2021 ) .
The multi - task learning approach of Ueda et al ( 2020 ) covers verbal predicate analysis ( which subsumes ZAR ) , and nominal predicate analysis , coreference resolution , and bridging anaphora resolution .
Their method is used as a state - of - the - art baseline in our experiments .
Konno et al ( 2020 ) perform data augmentation by simply masking some tokens .
They found that performance gains were achieved by selecting target tokens by part of speech .
Konno et al ( 2021 ) introduce a more elaborate masking strategy as a ZAR - speciﬁc intermediate task They spot multiple occurrences of the same noun phrase , mask one of them , and force the model to identify the pseudo - antecedent .
Our use of parallel texts in ZAR is inspired by Nakaiwa ( 1999 ) and Furukawa et al ( 2017 ) , who identify a multi - hop link from a Japanese zero pronoun to its Japanese antecedent via English counterparts .
Their rule - based methods suffer from accumulated errors and syntactically non - transparent correspondences .
In addition , they do not handle inter - sentential anaphora , a non - negligible subtype of anaphora we cover in this paper .
While we exploit MT to improve the performance of ZAR , the exploitation in the reverse direction has been studied .
A line of research has been done on Chinese zero pronoun prediction ( ZPP ) with a primary aim of improving Chinese - English translation ( Wang et al , 2016 , 2018 , 2019b ) .
ZPP is different from ZAR in that it does not identify antecedents .
This is understandable given that classiﬁcation of zero pronouns into overt ones sufﬁces for MT .
Although Wang et al ( 2019b ) report mutual beneﬁts between MT and ZPP , it remains an

2.2 MT as an Intermediate Task
Inspired by the great success of the pretraining/ﬁnetuning paradigm on a broad range of tasks ( Peters et al , 2018 ; Devlin et al , 2019 ) , a line of research inserts an intermediate task between pretraining and ﬁne - tuning on a target task ( Phang et al , 2018 ; Wang et al , 2019a ; Pruksachatkun et al , 2020 ) .
However , Wang et al ( 2019a ) found that MT used as an intermediate task led to performance degeneration in various target tasks , such as natural language inference and sentiment classiﬁcation.2 They argue that the considerable difference between MLM pretraining and MT causes catastrophic forgetting ( CF ) .
Pruksachatkun et al ( 2020 ) suggest injecting the MLM objective during intermediate training as a possible way to mitigate CF , which we empirically test in this paper .
2.3 Use of BERT in MT
Motivated by BERT ’s success in a wide range of applications , some studies incorporate BERT into MT models .
A straightforward way to do this is to initialize the encoder part of the encoder - decoder with pretrained BERT , but it has had mixed success at best ( Clinchant et al , 2019 ; Zhu et al , 2020 ) .
Abandoning this approach , Zhang et al ( 2020 ) simply use BERT as a supplier of context - aware embeddings to their own encoder - decoder model .
Similarly , Guo et al ( 2020 ) stack adapter layers on top of two frozen BERT models to use them as the encoder and decoder of a non - autoregressive MT
2We suspect that the poor performance resulted in part from their excessively simple decoder , a single - layer LSTM .

model .
However , these methods can not be adopted for our purpose because we want BERT itself to learn from MT .
Imamura and Sumita ( 2019 ) manage to maintain the straightforward approach by adopting a twostage training procedure :
In the ﬁrst stage , only the decoder is updated with the encoder frozen , while in the second stage , the entire model is updated .
Although they offer some insights , it remains unclear how best to exploit BERT when MT is an intermediate task , not the target task .
3 Proposed Method
We adopt a ZAR model of Ueda et al ( 2020 ) , which adds a thin layer on top of BERT during ﬁne - tuning to solve ZAR and related tasks ( Section 3.1 ) .
Instead of directly moving from MLM pretraining to ﬁne - tuning on ZAR , we inject MT as an intermediate task ( Section 3.2 ) .
In addition , we introduce the MLM training objective during the intermediate training ( Section 3.3 ) .

ZAR as argument selection As illustrated in Figure 3 , the basic idea behind BERT - based ZAR is that given the powerful neural encoder , the joint task of omission detection and antecedent identiﬁcation can be formalized as argument selection ( Shibata and Kurohashi , 2018 ; Kurita et al , 2018 ; Ueda et al , 2020 ) .
Omission detection concerns whether a given predicate has an argument for a given case ( relation ) .
If not , the model must point to the special token [ NULL ] .
Otherwise the model must identify the antecedent of the zero pronoun by pointing either to a token in the given text or to a special token reserved for exophora .
Note that by getting the entire document as the input , the model can handle inter - sentential anaphora as well as intra - sentential anaphora .
In practice , the input length limitation of BERT forces us to implement a sliding window approach .
Also note that in this formulation , ZAR is naturally subsumed into verbal predicate analysis ( VPA ) , which also covers instances where the predicate and the argument have a dependency relation and only the case marker is absent .
Formally , the probability of the token tj being
the argument of the predicate ti for case c is :
P ( tj|ti , c ) =
exp(sc(tj , ti ) ) j(cid:48 ) exp(sc(tj(cid:48 ) , ti ) )
( cid:80 )
sc(tj , ti ) = v(cid:124 ) tanh(Wctj + Ucti )
( 1 )
( 2 )
where ti is the context - aware embedding of ti provided by BERT , Wc and Uc are case - speciﬁc weight matrices , and v is a weight vector shared among cases .
We output tj with the highest probability .
For each predicate , we repeat this for the nominative ( NOM ) , accusative ( ACC ) , and dative ( DAT ) cases , and another nominative case for the double nominative construction ( NOM2 ) .
Input representations We append some special tokens at the end of the input sequence :
[ NULL ] for null arguments , and [ author ] , [ reader ] , and [ unspecified person ] for exophora .
The special token [ NA ] is also supplied for the reason given in the next paragraph .
As is usual for BERT , the special tokens
[ CLS ] and [ SEP ] are inserted at the beginning and end of the sequence , respectively .
If a predicate or argument candidate is split into two or more subwords , the initial subword is used for argument selection .
Multi - task learning Following Ueda et al ( 2020 ) , we use a single model to simultaneously perform verbal predicate analysis ( VPA ) , nominal predicate analysis ( NPA ) , bridging anaphora resolution ( BAR ) , and coreference resolution ( CR ) .
NPA is a variant of VPA in which verb - like nouns serve as predicates taking arguments .
BAR is a special kind of anaphora resolution in which the antecedent ﬁlls a semantic gap of the anaphor ( e.g. , " price " takes something priced as its argument ) .
CR identiﬁes the antecedent and anaphor that refer to the same real - world entity , with the special token [ NA ] reserved for nouns without coreferent mentions .
All of the four tasks can be formalized as argument selection as in Eq .
( 1 ) .
By sharing the BERT encoder , these interrelated tasks have an inﬂuence on each other during training .
In addition , case - speciﬁc weights are shared between VPA and NPA while separate weights are used for BAR and CR .
During training , we compute the losses equally for the four tasks .
3.2 MT as an Intermediate Task
Our main proposal is to use MT as an intermediate task prior to ﬁne - tuning on ZAR .
Following Imamura and Sumita ( 2019 ) and Clinchant et al ( 2019 ) , we use a pretrained BERT to initialize the encoder part of the Transformer - based encoderdecoder model while the decoder is randomly initialized .
After the intermediate training on MT , we extract the encoder and move on to ﬁne - tuning on ZAR and related tasks ( Figure 2 ) .
Speciﬁcally , we test the following two procedures for intermediate training :
One - stage optimization The entire model is updated throughout the training .
Two - stage optimization In the ﬁrst stage
, the encoder is frozen and only the decoder is updated .
In the second stage , the entire model is updated ( Imamura and Sumita , 2019 ) .
3.3
Incorporating MLM into MT
As discussed in Section 2.2 , MT as an intermediate task reportedly harms target - task performance , probably because MT forces the model to forget what it has learned from MLM pretraining ( catastrophic forgetting ) .
To overcome this problem , we incorporate the MLM training objective into MT , as suggested by Pruksachatkun et al ( 2020 ) .
Speciﬁcally , we mask some input tokens on the encoder

side and force the model to recover the original tokens , as depicted in the center of Figure 2 .
Our masking strategy is the same as BERT ’s ( Devlin et al , 2019 ):
We choose 15 % of the tokens at random and 80 % of them are replaced with [ MASK ] , 10 % of them with a random token , and the rest are unchanged .
The corresponding losses are added to the MT loss function .
4 Experiments
4.1 Datasets
ZAR We used two corpora in our experiments : the Kyoto University Web Document Lead Corpus ( Hangyo et al , 2012 ) and the Kyoto University Text Corpus ( Kawahara et al , 2002 ) .
Based on their genres , we refer to them as the Web and News , respectively .
These corpora have been widely used in previous studies ( Shibata and Kurohashi , 2018 ;
Kurita et al , 2018 ; Ueda et al , 2020 ) .
They contained manual annotation for predicate - argument structures ( including zero anaphora ) as well as word segmentation , part - of - speech tags , dependency relations , and coreference chains .
We split the datasets into training , validation , and test sets following the published setting , where the ratio was around 0.75:0.1:0.15 .
Key statistics are shown in Table 1 .
MT We used a Japanese - English parallel corpus of newspaper articles distributed by the Yomiuri Shimbun.3 It consisted of about 1.3 million sentence pairs4 with sentence alignment scores .
We discarded pairs with scores of 0 .
Because the task of interest , ZAR , required inter - sentential reasoning , consecutive sentences were concatenated into chunks , with the maximum number of tokens equal to that of ZAR .
As a result , we obtained around 373,000 , 21,000 , and 21,000 chunks for the training , validation , and test data , respectively .
Japanese sentences were split into words using the morphological analyzer MeCab with the Juman
dictionary ( Kudo et al , 2004).5
Both Japanese and English texts underwent subword tokenization .
We used Subword - NMT ( Sennrich et al , 2016 ) for Japanese and SentencePiece ( Kudo and Richardson , 2018 ) for English .
We used separate vocabularies for Japanese and English , with the vocabulary sizes of around 32,000 and 16,000 , respectively .
4.2 Model Settings
BERT We employed a Japanese BERT model with BPE segmentation distributed by NICT.6
It had the same architecture as Google ’s BERTBase ( Devlin et al , 2019 ): 12 layers , 768 hidden units , and 12 attention heads .
It was trained on the full text of Japanese Wikipedia for approximately 1 million steps .
MT We used the Transformer encoder - decoder architecture ( Vaswani et al , 2017 ) .
The encoder was initialized with BERT while the decoder was a randomly initialized six - layer Transformer .
The numbers of hidden units and heads were set to be the same as BERT ’s ( i.e. , 768 units and 12 attention heads ) .
We adopted Adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2017 ) as the optimizer .
We set the total number of epochs to 50 .
In two - stage optimization , the encoder was frozen during the ﬁrst 15 epochs , then the entire model was updated for the remaining 35 epochs .
We set a mini - batch size to about 500 .
The details of hyper - parameters are given in Appendix A.
ZAR
For a fair comparison with Ueda et al ( 2020 ) , we used almost the same conﬁguration as theirs .
We dealt with all subtypes of ZAR : intra - sentential anaphora , inter - sentential anaphora , and exophora .
For exophora , we targeted [ author ] , [ reader ] , and [ unspecified person ] .
We set the maximum sequence length to 128.7 All documents from the Web met this limitation .
In the News corpus , however , many documents exceeded the sequence length of 128 .
For such documents , we divided the document into multiple parts such that it had the longest preceding contexts .
The evaluation of ZAR was relaxed using a gold coreference chain .
The model was trained on the mixture of both corpora and evaluated on each corpus .
We used almost the same

We decided to tune the training epochs for MT since we found that it slightly affected ZAR performance .
We collected checkpoints at the interval of 5 epochs out of 45 epochs , in addition to the one with the lowest validation loss .
They were all trained on ZAR , and we chose the one with the highest score on the validation set .
We ran the model with 3 seeds on MT and with 3 seeds on ZAR , which resulted in 9 seed combinations .
We report the mean and the standard deviation of the 9 runs .
4.3 Results
Table 2 summarizes the experimental results .
Our baseline is Ueda et al ( 2020 ) , who drastically outperformed previous models , thanks to BERT .
+ MT refers to the model with intermediate training on MT while + MT w/ MLM corresponds to the model that incorporated the MLM objective into MT .
We can see that MT combined with MLM performed the best and that the gains reached 1.6 points for both the Web and News .
Tables 3 and 4 provide more detailed results .
For comparison , we performed additional pretraining with ordinary MLM on the Japanese part of the parallel corpus ( denoted as + MLM ) , because the possibility remained that the model simply took advantage of additional data .
The subsequent two blocks compare one - stage ( unmarked ) optimization with two - stage optimization .
MT yielded gains on all settings .
The gains were consistent across anaphora categories .
Although + MLM somehow beat the baseline , it was outperformed by most models trained on MT , ruling out the possibility that the gains were solely attributed to extra data .
We can

9We refer to errata posted on the ﬁrst author ’s website : https://nobu-g.github.io/pub/COLING2020 _ errata.pdf
conclude that Japanese ZAR beneﬁts from parallel texts through neural transfer learning .
Two - stage optimization showed mixed results .
It worked for the Web but did not for the News .
What is worse , its combination with MLM led to performance degeneration on both datasets .
MLM achieved superior performance as it worked well in all settings .
The gains were larger with one - stage optimization than with two - stage optimization ( 1.4 vs. 0.3 on the Web ) .
4.4 Translation of Zero Pronouns
The experimental results demonstrate that MT helps ZAR , but why does it work ?
Unfortunately , conventional evaluation metrics for MT ( e.g. , BLEU ) reveal little about the model ’s ability to handle zero anaphora .
To address this problem , Shimazu et al ( 2020 ) and Nagata and Morishita ( 2020 ) constructed Japanese - English parallel datasets that were designed to automatically evaluate MT models with regard to the translation of Japanese zero pronouns ( ZPT ) .
We used Shimazu et al ’s dataset for its larger data size.10
To facilitate automatic evaluation of ZPT , this dataset paired a correct English sentence with an incorrect one .
All we had to do was to calculate the ratio of instances for which the model assigned higher translation scores to the correct candidates .
The only difference between the two sentences involved the translation of a Japanese zero pronoun .
To choose the correct one , the MT model must sometimes refer to preceding sentences .
As in intermediate training , multiple source sentences were fed to the model to generate multiple target sentences .
We prepended as many preceding sentences as possible given the limit of 128 tokens .
In addition , this dataset recorded d , the sentencelevel distance between the zero pronoun in question and its antecedent .
The number of instances with d = 0 was 218 while the number of remaining instances was 506 .
We regarded the former as the instances of intra - sentential anaphora and the latter as the instances of inter - sentential anaphora .
We chose the model with the best performance ( i.e. , one - stage optimization with MLM ) .
For each checkpoint we collected during intermediate training , we ( 1 ) measured the ZPT accuracy and ( 2 ) ﬁnetuned it to obtain the F1 score for ZAR .
As before ,
10In this datasets , Japanese texts were translated from English broadcast conversations .
Despite the multifold domain mismatch ( i.e. , spoken and translationese ) , to our knowledge , this was the best dataset available for our purpose .

scores were averaged over 3 different seeds .
Through the course of intermediate training , we observed almost steady increase in ZPT accuracies and ZAR F1 scores until around the 30th epoch ( the four ﬁgures in Appendix D ) .
Table 5 shows the strong positive correlations between the two performance measures , especially the very strong correlation for inter - sentential anaphora .
These results were in line with our speculation that the performance gains in ZAR stemmed from the model ’s increased ability to translate zero pronouns .
4.5 Why Is MLM so Effective ?
The MLM objective during intermediate training on MT is shown to be very effective , but why ?
Pruksachatkun et al ( 2020 ) conjecture that it would mitigate catastrophic forgetting ( CF ) , but this is not the sole explanation .
In fact , Konno et al ( 2020 ) see token masking as a way to augment data .
Table 6 : Ablation study focusing on MLM .
All models were trained with one - stage optimization .
w/ masking indicates token masking without the corresponding loss function .
To dig into this question , we conducted an ablation study by introducing a model with token masking but without the corresponding loss function ( denoted as + MT w/ masking ) .
We assume that this model was largely deprived of the power to mitigate CF while token masking still acted as a data augmenter .
Table 6 shows the results .
Not surprisingly , + MT w/ masking was beaten by + MT w/ MLM with large margins .
However , it did outperform + MT , and the gain was particularly large for the Web .
The fact that the contribution of the loss function was larger than that of token masking indicates that the improvements were mainly attributed to CF mitigation , but the contribution of token masking
1926  alone should not be overlooked .
5 Conclusion
4.6 Case Studies
To gain further insights , we compared ZAR results with English translations automatically generated by the corresponding MT model .
Figure 4 gives two examples .
It is no great surprise that the translation quality was not satisfactory because we did not fully optimize the model for it .
In the exmple of Figure 4(a ) , MT seems to have helped ZAR .
The omitted nominative argument of “ あり ” ( is ) was correctly translated as “ the school ” , and the model successfully identiﬁed its antecedent “ 学校 ” ( school ) while the baseline failed .
Figure 4(b ) illustrates a limitation of the proposed approach .
The omitted nominative argument of the predicate , “ で ” ( be ) , points to “ 定吉 ” ( Sadakichi , the father of Jutaro ) .
Although the model correctly translated the zero pronoun as “ He ” , it failed in ZAR .
This is probably because not only “ 定吉 ( Sadakichi ) ” but also “ 龍馬 ” ( Ryoma ) and “ 重太郎 ” ( Jutaro ) can be referred to as “ He ” .
When disambiguation is not required to generate an overt pronoun , MT is not very helpful .
4.7 Note on Other Pretrained Models
Due to space limitation , we have limited our focus to BERT , but for the sake of future practitioners , we would like to brieﬂy note that we extensively tested BART ( Lewis et al , 2020 ) and its variants before switching to BERT .
Unlike BERT , BART is an encoder - decoder model pretrained on a monolingual corpus ( original ) or a non - parallel multilingual corpus ( mBART ) ( Liu et al , 2020 ) .
Because MT requires the encoder - decoder architecture , maintaining the model architecture between pretraining and intermediate training looked promising to us .
We speciﬁcally tested ( 1 ) the ofﬁcially distributed mBART model , ( 2 ) a BART model we pretrained on Japanese Wikipedia , and ( 3 ) an mBART model we pretrained on Japanese and English texts .
During ﬁne - tuning , we added the ZAR argument selection layer on top of either the encoder or the decoder .
Unfortunately , gains from MT intermediate training were marginal for these models .
A more serious problem was that they came close to but rarely outperformed the strong BERT baseline .
We gave up identifying the cause of poorer performance because it was extremely hard to apply comparable experimental conditions to large pretrained models .
In this paper , we proposed to exploit parallel texts for Japanese zero anaphora resolution ( ZAR ) by inserting machine translation ( MT ) as an intermediate task between masked language model ( MLM ) pretraining and ﬁne - tuning on ZAR .
Although previous studies reported negative results on the use of MT as an intermediate task , we demonstrated that it did work for Japanese ZAR .
Our analysis suggests that the intermediate training on MT simultaneously improved the model ’s ability to translate Japanese zero pronouns and the ZAR performance .
We bridged the gap between BERT - based ZAR and the encoder - decoder architecture for MT by initializing the encoder part of the MT model with a pretrained BERT .
Previous studies focusing on MT reported mixed results on this approach , but again , we demonstrated its considerable positive impact on ZAR .
We found that incorporating the MLM objective into the intermediate training was particularly effective .
Our experimental results were consistent with the speculation that MLM mitigated catastrophic forgetting during intermediate training .
With neural transfer learning , we successfully revived the old idea that Japanese ZAR can beneﬁt from parallel texts ( Nakaiwa , 1999 ) .
Thanks to the astonishing ﬂexibility of neural networks , we would probably be able to connect ZAR to other tasks through transfer learning .
