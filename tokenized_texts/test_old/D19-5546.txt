Abstract
There has been an increased interest in lowresource approaches to automatic grammatical error correction .
We introduce MinimallyAugmented Grammatical Error Correction ( MAGEC ) that does not require any errorlabelled data .
Our unsupervised approach is based on a simple but effective synthetic error generation method based on confusion sets from inverted spell - checkers .
In low - resource settings , we outperform the current state - ofthe - art results for German and Russian GEC tasks by a large margin without using any real error - annotated training data .
When combined with labelled data , our method can serve as an efﬁcient pre - training technique .
1 Introduction Most neural approaches to automatic grammatical error correction ( GEC ) require error - labelled training data to achieve their best performance .
Unfortunately , such resources are not easily available , particularly for languages other than English .
This has lead to an increased interest in unsupervised and low - resource GEC ( Rozovskaya et al . , 2017 ; Bryant and Briscoe , 2018 ; Boyd , 2018 ; Rozovskaya and Roth , 2019 ) , which recently culminated in the low - resource track of the Building Educational Application ( BEA ) shared task ( Bryant et al . , 2019).1
We present Minimally - Augmented Grammatical Error Correction ( MAGEC ) , a simple but effective approach to unsupervised and low - resource GEC which does not require any authentic error - labelled training data .
A neural sequence - to - sequence model is trained on clean and synthetically noised sentences alone .
The noise is automatically created from confusion sets .
Additionally , if labelled data 1https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/ bea2019stis available for ﬁne - tuning ( Hinton and Salakhutdinov , 2006 ) , MAGEC can also serve as an efﬁcient pre - training technique .
The proposed unsupervised synthetic error generation method does not require a seed corpus with example errors as most other methods based on statistical error injection ( Felice and Yuan , 2014 ) or back - translation models ( Rei et al . , 2017 ; Kasewa et al . , 2018 ; Htut and Tetreault , 2019 ) .
It also outperforms noising techniques that rely on random word replacements ( Xie et al . , 2018 ; Zhao et
al . , 2019 ) .
Contrary to Ge et al .
( 2018 ) or Lichtarge et
al .
( 2018 ) , our approach can be easily used for effective pre - training of full encoder - decoder models as it is model - independent and only requires clean monolingual data and potentially an available spell - checker dictionary.2In comparison to pretraining with BERT ( Devlin et
al . , 2019 ) , synthetic errors provide more task - speciﬁc training examples than masking .
As an unsupervised approach , MAGEC is an alternative to recently proposed language model ( LM ) based approaches ( Bryant and Briscoe , 2018 ; Stahlberg et al . , 2019 ) , but it does not require any amount of annotated sentences for tuning .
2 Minimally - augmented grammatical error correction Our minimally - augmented GEC approach uses synthetic noise as its primary source of training data .
We generate erroneous sentences from monolingual texts via random word perturbations selected from automatically created confusion sets .
These are traditionally deﬁned as sets of frequently confused words ( Rozovskaya and Roth , 2010 ) .
We experiment with three unsupervised methods for generating confusion sets : 2GNU Aspell supports more than 160 languages : http : //aspell.net / man - html / Supported.html

тем за - тем затеем затеям зятем затеями Table 1 : Examples of spell - broken confusion sets for English , German and Russian .
Edit distance Confusion sets consist of words with the shortest Levenshtein distance ( Levenshtein , 1966 ) to the selected confused word .
Word embeddings Confusion sets contain the most similar words to the confused word based on the cosine similarity of their word embedding vectors ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) .
Spell - breaking Confusion sets are composed of suggestions from a spell - checker ; a suggestion list is extracted for the confused word regardless of its actual correctness .
These methods can be used to build confusion sets for any alphabetic language.3We ﬁnd that confusion sets constructed via spell - breaking perform best ( Section 4 ) .
Most context - free spell - checkers combine a weighted edit distance and phonetic algorithms to order suggestions , which produces reliable confusion sets ( Table 1 ) .
We synthesize erroneous sentences as follows : given a confusion set Ci = fci 1 ; ci 2 ; ci 3 ; : : : g , and the vocabulary V , we sample word wj2Vfrom
the input sentence with a probability approximated with a normal distribution N(pWER;0:2 ) , and perform one of the following operations : ( 1 ) substitution ofwjwith a random word cj kfrom its confusion set with probability psub , ( 2 ) deletion of wjwith pdel , ( 3 ) insertion of a random word wk2Vat j+ 1 withpins , and ( 4 ) swapping wjandwj+1 withpswp .
When making a substitution , words within confusion sets are sampled uniformly .
To improve the model ’s capability of correcting spelling errors , inspired by Lichtarge et al .
( 2018 ) ; Xie et al .
( 2018 ) , we randomly perturb 10 % of characters using the same edit operations as above .
3For languages with logosylabic writing system like Chinese , the edit distance can be calculated on transcribed text , while word embeddings can be generated after wordsegmentation .

Character - level noise is introduced on top of the synthetic errors generated via confusion sets .
A MAGEC model is trained solely on the synthetically noised data and then ensembled with a language model .
Being limited only by the amount of clean monolingual data , this large - scale unsupervised approach can perform better than training on small authentic error corpora .
A large amount of training examples increases the chance that synthetic errors resemble real error patterns and results in better language modelling properties .
If any small amount of error - annotated learner data is available , it can be used to ﬁne - tune the pre - trained model and further boost its performance .
Pre - training of decoders of GEC models from language models has been introduced by Junczys - Dowmunt et al . ( 2018b ) , we pretrain the full encoder - decoder models instead , as proposed by Grundkiewicz et al .
( 2019 ) .
3 Experiments Data and evaluation Our approach requires a large amount of monolingual data that is used for generating synthetic training pairs .
We use the publicly available News crawl data5released for the WMT shared tasks ( Bojar et al . , 2018 ) .
For English and German , we limit the size of the data to 100 million sentences ; for Russian , we use all the available 80.5 million sentences .
As primary development and test data , we use the following learner corpora ( Table 2 ): English : the new W&I+LOCNESS corpus ( Bryant et al . , 2019 ; Granger , 1998 ) released for the BEA 2019 shared task and representing a diverse cross - section of English language ; German : the Falko - MERLIN GEC corpus ( Boyd , 2018 ) that combines two German learner corpora of all proﬁciency levels ; 4The original training part of Falco+MERLIN consists of 19,237 sentences , but is contaminated with some test sentences .
We have removed training examples if their target sentences occur in the development or test set .

Russian : the recently introduced RULECGEC dataset ( Alsuﬁeva et al . , 2012 ; Rozovskaya and Roth , 2019 ) containing Russian texts from foreign and heritage speakers .
Unless explicitly stated , we do not use the training parts of those datasets .
For each language we follow the originally proposed preprocessing and evaluation settings .
English and German data are tokenized with Spacy6 , while Russian is preprocessed with Mystem ( Segalovich , 2003 ) .
We additionally normalise punctuation in monolingual data using Moses scripts ( Koehn et al . , 2007 ) .
During training , we limit the vocabulary size to 32,000 subwords computed with SentencePiece using the unigram method ( Kudo and Richardson , 2018 ) .
English models are evaluated with ERRANT ( Bryant et al . , 2017 ) using F0:5 ; for German and Russian , the M2Scorer with the MaxMatch metric ( Dahlmeier and Ng , 2012 ) is used .
Synthetic data Confusion sets are created for each language for V= 96;000most frequent lexical word forms from monolingual data .
We use the Levenshtein distance to generate edit - distance based confusion sets .
The maximum considered distance is 2 .
Word embeddings are computed with word2vec7from monolingual data .
To generate spell - broken confusion sets we use Enchant8with Aspell dictionaries.9The size of confusion sets is limited to top 20 words .
Synthetic errors are introduced into monolingual texts to mimic word error rate ( WER ) of about 15 % , i.e. pWER = 0:15 , which resembles error frequency in common ESL error corpora .
When confusing a word , the probability psubis set to 0.7 , other probabilities are set to 0.1 .

Training settings We adapt the recent state - ofthe - art GEC system by Junczys - Dowmunt et al . ( 2018b ) , an ensemble of sequence - to - sequence Transformer models ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) and a neural language model.10 We use the training setting proposed by the authors11 , but introduce stronger regularization : we increase dropout probabilities of source words to 0.3 , add dropout on transformer self - attention and ﬁlter layers of 0.1 , and use larger mini - batches with 10Models and outputs are available from https:// github.com/grammatical/magec-wnut2019 11https://github.com/grammatical/ neural - naacl2018
360~2,500 sentences .
We do not pre - train the decoder parameters with a language model and train directly on the synthetic data .
We increase the size of language model used for ensembling to match the Transformer - big conﬁguration ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) with 16 - head self - attention , embeddings size of 1024 and feed - forward ﬁlter size size of 4096 .
In experiments with ﬁne - tuning , the training hyperparameters remain unchanged .
All models are trained with Marian ( JunczysDowmunt et al . , 2018a ) .
The training is continued for at most 5 epochs or until early - stopping is triggered after 5 stalled validation steps .
We found that using 10,000 synthetic sentences as validation sets , i.e. a fully unsupervised approach , is as effective as using the development parts of error corpora and does not decrease the ﬁnal performance .
4 Results and analysis Confusion sets On English data , all proposed confusion set generation methods perform better than random word substitution ( Table 3).Confusion sets based on word embeddings are the least effective , while spell - broken sets perform best at 26.66 F0:5 .
We observe further gains of +1.04 from keeping out - of - vocabulary spell - checker suggestions ( OOV ) and preserving consistent letter casing within confusion sets ( Case ) .
The word error rate of error corpora is an useful statistic that can be used to balance precision / recall ratios ( Rozovskaya and Roth , 2010 ; Junczys - Dowmunt et al . , 2018b ; Hotate et al . , 2019 ) .
Increasing WER in the synthetic data from 15 % to 25 % increases recall at the expense of precision , but no overall improvement is observed .
A noticeable recall gain that transfers to a higher F - score of 28.99 is achieved by increasing the importance of edited fragments with the edit - weighted MLE objective from Junczys - Dowmunt et al . ( 2018b ) with = 2 .
We use this setting for the rest of our experiments .
Main results We ﬁrst compare the GEC systems with simple baselines using a greedy and context spell - checking ( Table 4 ) ; the latter selects the best correction suggestion based on the sentence perplexity from a Transformer language model .
All systems outperform the spell - checker baselines .
On German and Russian test sets , single MAGEC models without ensembling with a language model already achieve better performance than reported by Boyd ( 2018 ) and Rozovskaya andSystem CoNLL JFLEG Bryant and Briscoe ( 2018 ) ?

Our best unsupervised ensemble systems that combine three Transformer models and a LM12outperform the state - of - the - art results for these languages by +7.0 and +11.4 F0:5 .
Our English models do not compete with the top systems ( Grundkiewicz et al . , 2019 ) from the BEA shared task trained on publicly available errorannotated corpora ( Table 4a ) .
It is difﬁcult to compare with the top low - resource system from the shared task , because it uses additional parallel data from Wikipedia ( Grundkiewicz and JunczysDowmunt , 2014 ) , larger ensemble , and n - best list re - ranking with right - to - left models , which can be also implemented in this work .
MAGEC systems are generally on par with the results achieved by a recent unsupervised contribution based on ﬁnite state transducers by Stahlberg et al .
( 2019 ) on the CoNLL-2014 ( Dahlmeier et al . , 2013 ) and JFLEG test sets ( Napoles et

All unsupervised systems beneﬁt from domainadaptation via ﬁne - tuning on authentic labelled data ( Miceli Barone et al . , 2017 ) .
The more authentic high - quality and in - domain training data is used , the greater the improvement , but even as few as ~2,000 sentences are helpful ( Fig . 1 ) .
We found that ﬁne - tuning on a 2:1 mixture of synthetic and oversampled authentic data prevents the model from over-ﬁtting .
This is particularly visible for English which has the largest ﬁne - tuning set ( 34 K sentences ) , and the difference of 5.2 F0:5between ﬁnetuning with and without synthetic data is largest .
Spelling and punctuation errors The GEC task involves detection and correction of all types of error in written texts , including grammatical , lexical and orthographical errors .
Spelling and punctuation errors are among the most frequent error types and also the easiest to synthesize .
To counter the argument that – mostly due to the introduced character - level noise and strong language modelling – MAGEC can only correct these “ simple ” errors , we evaluate it against test sets that contain either spelling and punctuation errors or all other error types ; with the complement errors corrected ( Table 6 ) .
Our systems indeed perform best on misspellings and punctuation errors , but are capable of correcting various error types .
The disparity for Russian can be explained by the fact that it is a morphologically - rich language and we suffer from generally lower performance .
5 Conclusions and future work We have presented Minimally - Augmented Grammatical Error Correction ( MAGEC ) , which can be effectively used in both unsupervised and lowresource scenarios .
The method is model independent , requires easily available resources , and can be used for creating reliable baselines for supervised techniques or as an efﬁcient pre - training method for neural GEC models with labelled data .
We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method and outperformed state - of - the - art results for Germanand Russian benchmarks , trained with labelled data , by a large margin .
For future work , we plan to evaluate MAGEC on more languages and experiment with more diversiﬁed confusion sets created with additional unsupervised generation methods .
