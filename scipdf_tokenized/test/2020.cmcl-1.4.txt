Evaluating Word Embeddings for Language Acquisition
Continuous vector word representations ( or word embeddings ) have shown success in capturing semantic relations between words , as evidenced by evaluation against behavioral data of adult performance on semantic tasks ( Pereira et al , 2016 ) . Adult semantic knowledge is the endpoint of a language acquisition process ; thus , a relevant question is whether these models can also capture emerging word representations of young language learners . However , the data for children 's semantic knowledge across development is scarce . In this paper , we propose to bridge this gap by using Age of Acquisition norms to evaluate word embeddings learnt from child - directed input . We present two methods that evaluate word embeddings in terms of ( a ) the semantic neighbourhood density of learnt words , and ( b ) convergence to adult word associations . We apply our methods to bag - of - words models , and find that ( 1 ) children acquire words with fewer semantic neighbours earlier , and ( 2 ) young learners only attend to very local context . These findings provide converging evidence for validity of our methods in understanding the prerequisite features for a distributional model of word learning .
Word embeddings have a long tradition in Computational Linguistics . There exist a range of methods to derive word embeddings based on the distributional paradigm , such that words with similar embeddings are semantically related . These embeddings are often evaluated either extrinsically , on how well they boost performance on a certain task , or intrinsically , by comparing representations against behavioral data from tests of semantic sim - ilarity , synonymity , analogy or word association ( Pereira et al , 2016 ) . Adult semantic knowledge is the culmination of a language acquisition process ; therefore , a relevant question is whether these models can also capture emerging word representations of language learners . A capacity for distributional analysis is a basic assumption of all theories of language acquisition : children are capable of performing distributional analyses over their input from a young age ( Saffran et al , 1996 ) , motivating the use of word embeddings for modelling language acquisition . However , the evaluation of emergent word representations is far from straightforward , as there is no availability of the kind of semantic judgements that we have for adults . This paper presents two methods for evaluating word embeddings for language acquisition . We apply our methods to two bag - of - words models , and evaluate them on the acquisition of nouns in English - speaking children 1 .
Bag - of - words models offer a good starting point to evaluate word representations in the context of language acquisition , given their minimal assumptions on knowledge of word order : once the context of a word is determined , the order in which words appear in this context is ignored by these type of models . We explore a range of hyperparameter configurations of two models : a ' contextcounting ' model involving a PPMI matrix compressed with Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) , and the Skipgram with Negative Sampling ( SGNS ) version of word2vec ( Mikolov et al , 2013 ) . Note that , although these models have been found to implicitly optimize the same shifted - PPMI matrix ( Levy and Goldberg , 2014 ) , they are unlikely to obtain the same results without careful parameter alignment . Our goal by selecting these two approaches is to increase the variability of model performance within the bag - of - words paradigm . The hyperparameters we explore include : window size [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 ] , minimum frequency threshold [ 10 , 50 , 100 ] , dynamic window ( for SGNS ) , negative sampling in SGNS [ 0 , 15 ] ( and its equivalents as shifted - PPMI ) , eigenvalue in SVD [ 0 , 0.5 , 1 ] . We restrict our analyses to vectors of size 100 . We use the Hyperwords package from Levy et al ( 2015 ) .
We trained the models on transcriptions of childdirected speech , i.e. samples of naturalistic productions in the linguistic environment of a child . We extracted the child - directed speech data from the CHILDES database ( MacWhinney , 2000 ) , for all the varieties of English , for ages ranging from 0 to 60 months . We used the childesr library to extract the child - directed utterances ( Sanchez et al , 2019 ) 2 . Word tokens were coded at the lemma level . The resulting dataset contains a total number of 3 , 135 , 822 sentences , 34 , 961 word types , and 12 , 975 , 520 word tokens . To evaluate the models , we used data collected with the MacArthur - Bates Communicative Development Inventory forms ( CDI ) . These are forms , given to parents of young children , that contain checklists of common early acquired words . Parents complete the forms according to whether their child understands or produces each of those words . These forms are collected at different ages , and thus can be used to estimate the Age of Acquisition ( AoA ) of words . We used all the variants of English ' Words & Sentences ' CDIs from the Wordbank database ( Frank et al , 2017 ) , with the exception of those involving twins ( as significant differences have been observed in the language development of twins and singletons , Tomasello et al , 1986 ) . We estimated the AoA of a word by considering that a word is acquired at the age at which at least 50 % of the children in the sample produced a given word . 2 http://childes - db.stanford.edu/about . html 4 Method 1 : Neighbourhood Density Our first evaluation method is inspired by prior work on human word learning , presented in Hills et al ( 2010 ) . In their work , the authors modeled the emerging network of semantic associations that children build during language acquisition . Their model consists of a simple word co - occurrence matrix , where all the counts greater than zero are flattened into a count of one , resulting in a binary matrix . The authors view the resulting matrix as a network of associations , where words are connected only if they have co - occurred . The number of connections of each word is then used as an index , which the authors call Contextual Diversity ( CD ) . This index has been repeatedly shown to predict language acquisition phenomena , such as the age of acquisition of words in different syntactic categories ( Hills et al , 2010 ; Stella et al , 2017 ) and individual differences between typically developing children and late talkers ( Beckage et al , 2011 ) . We propose a variant evaluation method that takes token co - occurrences into account . Because of the binarization of the co - occurrence matrix , the CD index is an indicator of type co - occurrences , and is therefore agnostic to co - occurrence frequency . The models we work with , on the contrary , are sensitive to co - occurrence frequencies , providing a more fine - grained characterization of the semantic space . Our method works as follows . First , we derived the semantic networks based on the cosine distance between representations . This required us to set a minimum cosine similarity threshold Î¸ to determine if two words are connected , which we treat as a hyperparameter ( with values [ .6 , .7 , .8 , .9 ] ) . Second , given this network , we counted the number of neighbours of each word as the number of other words connected to it . We refer to this index as neighbourhood density ( ND ) . Third , we computed the Pearson 's r correlation between this index and the AoA norms . Figure 1 shows the distribution of the computed metric . Note that these correlations can not be expected to be of the same order as those found when evaluating against adult ratings , since age of acquisition is predicted by a variety of factors , of which distributional information is only one , and it is subject to greater individual differences than adult semantic knowledge . Therefore , moderate but significant correlations are generally consid - ered meaningful . As a reference , the CD index , has a correlation of r = 0.32 in our dataset 3 . As can be seen , the SGNS model is more likely to provide a semantic space that correlates with AoA , and some configurations yield an effect size comparable ( even larger ) than the CD metric . This indicates that the SGNS model builds word representations in a way that reflects the relative difficulty of each word , and thus offers a good starting point for understanding how children use distributional context for vocabulary acquisition . The fact that the correlation is positive prompts the prediction that , when co - occurrence frequency is incorporated in the model , words inhabiting less dense neighbourhoods are acquired earlier . This finding suggests that semantic neighbours may act as competitors in the process of word learning . Among the hyperparameters of these models , one that is particularly relevant to language acquisition is the window size , as this reveals the amount of context that children most likely attend to in the analyzed ages . To investigate this , we took the best model of our previous analyses ( SGNS with window size 1 , negative sampling 15 , frequency threshold 10 ) , and varied only the window size . Results are in figure 2 . As can be seen , smaller window sizes have better correlation with the data , indicating that the exploited context at this age is very local . Such a result makes intuitive sense in the context of children 's immature verbal memory spans , which only improve as they acquire more language .
Our first evaluation method above focused on the structure of the semantic spaces provided by the learnt word embeddings . Now we turn our attention to the specific lexical items and their position in the semantic space . Children tend to under - and overextend word meaning in the first stages of acquisition , and over time they become more precise on capturing the semantics of words . A logical assumption then , is that words learnt earlier also converge earlier to adult - like semantic representations ( assuming that early and late words take , on average , approximately the same amount of time to converge ) . We incorporated this idea in our second method by relating the AoA of words with adult free word association norms . Note that this method can be applied to other semantic tasks , but we focus on word association because it does not impose the specific type of semantic relation that words need to have ( i.e. there is no distinction between similarity , analogy or others ) . The dataset of free word association that we used is known as Small World of Worlds ( SWOW , De Deyne et al , 2019 ) , and it is the largest dataset of word associations in English , containing responses to over 12 , 000 cue words . We filtered the preprocessed version of the dataset to include only words that have been acquired before 60 months old . This results in 613 cue words , and 1839 responses ( word associates ) to these cues . We then performed a similar cue - response experiment , with the best model from the previous section : for each cue , we retrieved the closest n neighbours . As in Pereira et al ( 2016 ) , we used n = 50 , and then computed how many of these neighbours overlap with the word associates ( responses ) provided by human adults . However , unlike that work , our evaluation is not based directly on the number of overlaps . Instead , we computed the Spearman rank correlation between the number of overlaps and the AoA norms , in order to quantify whether word embeddings corresponding to words learned earlier by children are also those that are converging faster to adult semantic knowledge . Figure 3 shows the result of this procedure . As can be seen , there is a statistically significant rank correlation ( Ï = â0.378 , p < 0.001 ) . The negative direction confirms that words acquired earlier have a network of word associates that is more similar to those of adults , suggesting that convergence to adult semantic knowledge is at a more advanced state . One limitation of this procedure is that it requires a choice on the number of neighbours to be retrieved . In order to see how much the metric is affected by this parameter , we report the rank correlations of the previous model for several values of n. As can be seen in Figure 4 , this number stabilizes after n = 25 . The figure also shows whether this metric favours a model that did not perform well in our previous evaluation metric ( SVD with window size 4 , shift 15 , frequency threshold 10 ) . The graph shows that this model is consistently worse on our second evaluation method as well .
We proposed two methods to evaluate word embeddings for language acquisition . The main feature of these methods is the use of AoA norms for assessing whether the semantic organization of the word embeddings support the developmental trajectory of word learning . The use of these metrics already prompted the discovery that ( 1 ) words with fewer neighbours are easier to acquire , suggesting competition of neighbouring words , and ( 2 ) at young age , infants only attend to very local context . The application of these methods to distributional models that incorporate additional assumptions ( e.g. knowledge of word order ) holds promise for further understanding of the role of distributional information in word learning .
