Will I Sound Like Me ?
Improving Persona Consistency in Dialogues through Pragmatic Self - Consciousness
We explore the task of improving persona consistency of dialogue agents .
Recent models tackling consistency often train with additional Natural Language Inference ( NLI ) labels or attach trained extra modules to the generative agent for maintaining consistency .
However , such additional labels and training can be demanding .
Also , we find even the bestperforming persona - based agents are insensitive to contradictory words .
Inspired by social cognition and pragmatics , we endow existing dialogue agents with public self - consciousness on the fly through an imaginary listener .
Our approach , based on the Rational Speech Acts framework ( Frank and Goodman , 2012 ) , can enforce dialogue agents to refrain from uttering contradiction .
We further extend the framework by learning the distractor selection , which has been usually done manually or randomly .
Results on Dialogue NLI ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) and PersonaChat ( Zhang et al , 2018 ) dataset show that our approach reduces contradiction and improves consistency of existing dialogue models .
Moreover , we show that it can be generalized to improve contextconsistency beyond persona in dialogues .
In the study of dialogue agents , consistency has been a long - standing issue .
To resolve this , much research has been conducted to endow dialogue agents with personas .
Li et al ( 2016 ) propose to encode persona in embeddings and Zhang et al ( 2018 ) introduce a persona - conditioned dialogue dataset .
On top of these works , many efforts have been made to improve consistency . 
In spite of such recent significant progress , there is much room for improving persona - based dialogue agents .
We observe that even the best performing persona - based generative models ( See et al , 2019 ; Wolf et al , 2019b ; I like to stay at home .
Literal Agent : !
I like going outside . 
Interlocutor Self - Conscious Agent : "
I like going outside .
I love Disneyland !
I go there every week . 
' Will I sound like me ? '
Figure 1 : Illustration of the consistency issue in dialogue .
While a literal dialogue agent ( S 0 ) fails to deliver a consistent persona , our self - conscious agent ( S 1 ) does so , by modeling an imaginary listener .
Icons are designed by Nhor Phai and Vincent Le Moign . are highly insensitive to contradictory words , and thus fail to deliver consistent persona to the interlocutor ( Figure 1 ) .
Also , extra modules other than the generative model is often required for improving consistency .
Recent works on consistency in persona - based dialogue actively adopt the NLIbased approach ( Welleck et al , 2019 ; Song et al , 2019 ; Li et al , 2020 ; Song et al , 2020 ) , which have the following prerequisites .
First , they require labeled pairs of persona sentences and dialogue utterances with three categories : entailment , neutral , and contradiction .
Next , methods with NLI models for rating the agent 's consistency also need to train them separately with those labels . 
In this work , we step back from this NLI - based supervised approach and ponder : how do humans maintain consistency ?
We humans never learn how to be consistent .
Instead , we have an innate drive for consistency to hold our beliefs and behavior in harmony ( Festinger , 1962 ) .
If so , how do we know we are consistent or not ?
We do not ask others .
We ask ourselves by predicting how we are perceived by others .
Public self - consciousness is this awareness of the self as a social object that can be observed and evaluated by others ( Fenigstein et al , 1975 ) .
We particularly emphasize that public self - consciousness is not equivalent to the philosophical self - consciousness ( or self - awareness ) 1 .
Simply put , public self - consciousness is the concern about how oneself will be perceived by others , as opposed to the philosophical state of being conscious of self - existence . 
According to Doherty and Schlenker ( 1991 ) , people with high public self - consciousness tend to act more consistent with known information about themselves .
They care deeply about how others will evaluate them and have a strong tendency to avoid negative evaluations ( Fenigstein et al , 1975 ) .
Since inconsistency is condemned by others , one who has high public self - consciousness will try more to maintain consistency .
In order to predict how we are perceived , we rely on abstract models of others ( Gopnik and Wellman , 1992 ) and simulate others ' reactions based on imagination ( Hassabis et al , 2013 ) .
Inspired by this , our intuition is that self - consciousness through an imaginary listener will let dialogue agents better maintain consistency . 
Modeling a listener has been one of the main topics in computational pragmatics .
Our work extends this long line of work in cognitive science by making use of the Bayesian Rational Speech Acts framework ( Frank and Goodman , 2012 ) , which has been originally applied to improving informativeness of referring expressions .
Since personas ought to express who we are , we adopt this framework for dialogue agents by regarding personas as targets that should be conveyed to the interlocutor .
As the agent tries to generate tokens that help the imaginary listener identify the agent 's persona , it can lastly generate more consistent utterances . 
In summary , we take inspiration from social cognition and pragmatics to endow generative agents with self - consciousness , which makes them imagine the listener 's reaction and incorporate it to the generation process for improving consistency .
Our major contributions can be outlined as follows : ( 1 ) We propose an orthogonally applicable approach for any persona - based generative agents to improve consistency without the use of additional consistency labels and training .
Moreover , it is even generalizable to improve context - consistency beyond persona in dialogue . 
( 2 ) We extend the Rational Speech Acts framework ( Frank and Goodman , 2012 ) with two new technical features : ( i ) a learning method for distractor selection ( e.g. other samples different from the given target ( Andreas and Klein , 2016 ) ) , which has been usually done manually or randomly , and ( ii ) a different update for the listener 's world prior that better preserves information of previous states . 
( 3 ) Our approach improves consistency of three recent generative agents ( See et al , 2019 ; Wolf et al , 2019b ; over Dialogue NLI ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) and PersonaChat ( Zhang et al , 2018 ) .
Along with large reduction in contradiction , the utterance accuracy significantly increases too .
Persona & Consistency in Dialogue .
Li et al ( 2016 ) learn personas in embeddings .
Zhang et al ( 2018 ) release the PersonaChat dataset , a chitchat dialogue set involving two interlocutors each playing their given persona .
Madotto et al ( 2019 ) use meta - learning to adapt to new personas with few dialogue samples .
use reinforcement learning to enhance mutual persona perception . 
Recent works use extra modules or NLI labels to improve consistency .
Shum et al ( 2019 ) fill generated templates , and rank with a language model .
use self - supervised feature extractors for generation .
Welleck et
al ( 2019 ) annotate NLI labels to the PersonaChat dataset .
They train an NLI model and run pairwise comparison between candidates and persona to compute contradiction scores .
The NLI approach is applied for coherence evaluation ( Dziri et al , 2019 ) , rewards to reinforcement learning agents ( Song et al , 2019 ) , finding inconsistent words ( Song et al , 2020 ) , and unlikelihood training ( Li et al , 2020 ) .
They require NLI labels on the target dialogue dataset ; otherwise , sharp decrease in performance is observed , due to mismatch of data distribution
( Welleck et al , 2019 ) .
Such dataset - specific NLI annotations and training NLI models can be costly and time - consuming . 
Compared to previous methods , the novelty of our approach is to improve consistency without NLI labels and extra modules . 
Pragmatics .
Our approach belongs to the general family of Bayesian Rational Speech Acts ( Andreas and Klein , 2016 ) , image captioning ( Mao et al , 2016 ;
Vedantam et al , 2017 ; Cohn - Gordon et al , 2018 ) , instruction following ( Fried et al , 2017 ) , navigating ( Fried et al , 2018 ) , translation ( Cohn - Gordon and Goodman , 2019 ) , summarization ( Shen et al , 2019 ) and referring expression generation ( Zarrieß and Schlangen , 2019 ) .
However , its application to the dialogue domain remains understudied .
In this work , we explore how the RSA framework can be adopted in dialogue agents to alleviate the inconsistency problem .
Also , we further extend the framework by making the distractor selection as a learnable process .
( Zhang et al , 2018 ) .
They collect entailing and contradictory utterances to the given persona , and release an evaluation set comprised of dialogues each with 31 utterance candidates : 10 entailing , 10 neutral , and 10 contradictory utterances with 1 ground - truth ( GT ) utterance .
On this evaluation set , we run three recent models ( See et al , 2019 ;
Wolf et al , 2019b et al , 2020 ) that achieve the best performance on PersonaChat .
We report four ranking metrics following Welleck et al ( 2019 ) : Hits@1 , Entail@1 , Neutral@1 and Contradict@1 .
Each metric is the proportion of GT , entailing , neutral and contradictory utterances in the top - 1 candidates returned by the model , respectively .
The models rank the candidates by perplexity scores . 
Figure 2 shows that all three models select contradictory candidates much more often than the GT utterances ( see further results in Table 3 ) .
Though models are conditioned on a given persona , they are highly insensitive to contradictions .
To investigate why insensitivity to contradiction prevails in the state - of - the - art models , we further analyze the contradictory utterances returned by the models ( Contradict@1 - Utt ) , comparing with the GT utterances and the top - ranked entailing candidates ( Top Entail - Utt ) .
Table 1 reports language metrics between the selected candidates and the given persona sentences using SPICE ( Anderson et al , 2016 ) and ROUGE ( Lin , 2004 ) .
SPICE metric measures semantic similarity and ROUGE metric measures n - gram overlaps between two sentences .
Contradict@1 - Utt shows lower SPICE scores and higher ROUGE scores than other utterances , implying that it may be different in semantics but similar in syntax to the given persona . 
To take a closer look , we extract the contradicting words from Contradict@1 - Utt and their counterparts from GT utterances to compare their average perplexity scores .
In the Dialogue NLI dataset , every utterance is labeled with a triple ( entity 1 , relation , entity 2 ) , such as " I just like to listen to rock music " with ( i , like music , rock ) . 
By construction , Contradict@1 - Utt must contain words that are contradictory to the GT utterance and the given persona .
The perplexity scores of contradictory words ( 106.7 ) were considerably lower than those of the counterparts in GT utterances ( 280.1 ) .
Table 2 shows an example of such dialogue instance with perplexity per word .
If properly conditioned with the given persona , models should show lower perplexity for the words in the persona .
However , their perplexity scores are significantly higher than those of contradictory words .
It reveals that models behave more as a plain language model rather than as a persona - conditioned model .
Thus , guarantee of consistency for each word generation step is required for persona - based dialogue agents to resolve such issue .
We introduce how to endow dialogue agents with public self - consciousness , which helps them keep consistency in mind at each generation step by reflecting an imaginary listener 's distribution over personas .
Since the imaginary listener arises from the plain dialogue - agent , separate training is not needed .
Figure 3 illustrates its overall structure . 
We present how to model public selfconsciousness using the Rational Speech Acts ( RSA ) framework ( Frank and Goodman , 2012 ) in Section 4.1 .
We then discuss learning of distractor selection as our major novelty for the RSA in Section 4.2 .
We seek to build a dialogue agent who is selfconscious about its consistency without the need for training on NLI labels or rating consistency with NLI models .
Given that modeling the interactions between listener and speaker is a main topic in pragmatics , we take advantage of the RSA framework ( Frank and Goodman , 2012 ) .
It treats language use as a recursive process where probabilistic speaker and listener reason about each other 's intentions in a Bayesian fashion .
To apply the framework to sequence generation for dialogues , we extend the incremental approach proposed for image captioning ( Cohn - Gordon et al , 2018 ) . 
To generate an utterance , the agent computes the distribution of every next token u t at timestep t in Bayesian fashion as follows . 
Base Speaker S 0 .
We first assume persona i is given to the base speaker , along with the dialogue ∝ # " ℎ , $ " , " % × # " " , ℎ , & " ) " ' !
( ) Imaginary Listener : # " ( | $ " , ℎ , " )
Base Speaker : # " " , ℎ , & " ) Figure 3 : The proposed self - conscious agent S 1 consists of base speaker S 0 and imaginary listener L 0 .
It recursively generates the next token u t at every time t. history h and partial utterance u < t , as shown in Figure 3 .
The base speaker S t 0 returns a distribution over the next token at timestep t : S t 0
( u t | i , h , u < t ) .
Any conditional dialogue agent can be used as a base speaker .
See the details in Section 5.2 . 
Imaginary Listener L 0 .
While the base speaker generates each token one at a time , the imaginary listener reasons about the speaker 's persona .
The imaginary listener L t 0 is the posterior distribution of the speaker 's persona in terms of the base speaker and the world prior p t ( i ) over personas as follows , L t 0
( i | h , u ≤t , p t ) ∝ S t 0
( u t | i , h , u < t ) β × p t ( i )
i I S t 0
( u t | i , h , u < t ) β × p t ( i ) . 
( 1 ) where β on S t 0 is the listener rationality coefficient that controls the amount of information from the current timestep compared to the cumulative prior p t ( i ) .
L 0 returns a probability distribution over the personas in world I , which is a finite set ( | I | = 3 ) comprising the given persona i and distractor personas .
The distractors are different personas from other dialogue instances in the dataset .
We decide world I per dialogue instance through learning , which will be elaborated in Section 4.2 . Self - Conscious Speaker S 1 .
With S t 0 and L t 0 , the self - conscious speaker S t 1 is defined as S t 1 ( u t | i , h , u < t )
∝ L t 0
( i | h , u ≤t , p t )
α × S t 0
( u t | i , h , u < t ) , ( 2 ) where α is the speaker rationality coefficient that determines how much the likelihood is considered .
By taking the listener 's distribution into account , the speaker is now self - conscious about what persona it sounds like .
Especially , the agent seeks to be perceived as the given persona
i rather than some other persona i .
The likelihood of each token being identified as the persona i acts as a bonus added to the base speaker 's token scores .
Hence , tokens that are consistent to the given persona are preferred to others .
The token with the highest probability is added to the partial utterance , becoming the next input u < t+1 for the speaker . 
Updating the world prior with L 0 .
Starting from a uniform distribution as the initial prior p 0
( i ) , we update the world prior p t+1 ( i ) according to S 1 's output u t at every time step : 
p t+1 ( i )
= L t 0
( i | h , u ≤t , p t ) .
( 3 ) Hence , p t ( i ) represents the cumulative state of the partial utterance up to t. Cohn - Gordon et al ( 2018 ) report the prior update with L 1 ∝ S t 0
( u t | i , h , u < t ) × L t 0
( i | h , u ≤t , p t ) makes little practical effect compared to a uniform prior .
We find that updating the prior with Eq .
( 3 ) instead is effective .
See the results in Section 5.6 .
Distractors ( Andreas and Klein , 2016 ) are samples ( e.g. other personas in the dataset ) which are different from the given target .
In previous works of RSA , the distractors to be included in world I are selected manually or randomly from the dataset .
However , we find that performance variance is large according to the selected distractors .
We thus propose to learn distractor selection , especially based on the life - long memory network ( Kaiser et al , 2017 ) .
The life - long memory network is capable of implicitly clustering similar dialogue contexts into a few slots with associated persona .
Therefore , it can efficiently memorize and retrieve distractor personas for each context .
In Appendix , we experiment that our approach outperforms other models including BERT - based algorithms . 
To better select useful distractor personas , supervised learning is desirable .
However , there is no explicit label indicating which distractors are helpful for each dialogue .
We select the persona that have the best Hits@1 as the distractor label per training dialogue .
The Hits@1 is the score for favoring the ground - truth next utterance ( consistent and context - relevant ) over other candidate utterances which are just being consistent ( i.e. entailing ) or contradictory to the given persona .
In other words , the score represents consistency and also appropriateness at the same time .
Thus , such distractors can help the self - conscious agent to generate responses which are context - relevant and allow the imaginary listener to identify the speaker 's persona .
Each training datapoint comprises a given persona , a distractor persona and dialogue context . 
Memory Structure .
The memory consists of three types of information : M = ( K , v , a ) .
K R m×d is a key matrix , where m is the number of memory slots and d is the dimension of the key vectors , which are the embedding of datapoints .
The value vector v R m stores the index of a persona .
a R m is an age vector , which is used for memory update .
We set m = 16 , 000 and d = 768 . 
Memory Addressing .
We construct the query vector q for each datapoint with the BERT - Uncased - Base ( Devlin et al , 2019 ) model .
We use the output embedding of BERT 's [ CLS ] token , and normalize it to a unit length to build q R d . 
Using the cosine similarity between q and each memory key , we can find the k nearest neighbors : ( n 1 , n 2 , ... , n k ) =
N N k ( q , K ) .
( 4 ) Memory Loss .
Suppose that the query datapoint has a distractor label l.
Among ( n 1 , ... , n k ) , we denote the positive neighbor n p as the one with v [ n p ]
= l and the negative neighbor n b with v [ n b ] = l. If there are multiple positive neighbors , we pick the one with the smallest memory index .
If no positive neighbor is found , we select a random key whose value is l. For the negative neighbor , we select one randomly from ( n 1 , ... , n k ) .
We set k = 2048 .
Then , the loss is computed as L = max ( q K [ n b ] − q K [ n p ]
+ α , 0 ) , ( 5 ) where α is a positive margin , which we set as 0.2 .
This loss maximizes the cosine similarity between the query q and the positive key K [ n p ] , while minimizing the similarity to the negative key K [ n b ] .
We finetune the query network BERT with this loss . 
Memory Update .
After computing the loss , memory M is updated differently for two cases . 
( 1 ) If the top - 1 neighbor 's value ( i.e. persona ) is correct ( v [ n 1 ] = l ) , the key vector is updated as : K [ n 1 ]
q + K [ n 1 ] q + K [ n 1 ] .
( 6 ) ( 2 )
Otherwise ( v [ n 1 ] = l ) , we make a slot for the query ; we find the oldest memory slot n according to the age vector a and write K
[
n ] q , v [ n ] l , a [ n ] 0 .
( 7 ) Training & Inference .
In our Distractor Memory network , training corresponds to updating the memory and the parameters of the query network . 
At inference , given a test example , we obtain the query by encoding the dialogue context and the persona using BERT .
We find n nearest keys from the memory , and use their values ( i.e. persona indices ) as the distractor personas .
We set n = 2 .
We show that our self - conscious framework can significantly improve consistency and accuracy of state - of - the - art persona - based agents on two benchmark datasets .
We prove its effectiveness using both automatic and human evaluations .
We also show our framework can be generalized to improve consistency of dialogue context beyond persona .
Dialogue NLI Evaluation Set ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) .
This dataset is based on PersonaChat with additional NLI annotations .
Its main task is to rank next - utterance candidates given previous context .
For each dialogue , they collect 31 next - utterance candidates in respect to the given persona : 10 entailing , 10 neutral and 10 contradicting candidates with 1 ground - truth utterance .
In total , the evaluation set includes 542 instances . 
PersonaChat dialogue ( Zhang et al , 2018 ) .
This dataset involves two interlocutors who are each given a persona and asked to get to know each other while playing their roles .
This task was the subject of the ConvAI2 competition ( Dinan et al , 2019 ) at NeurIPS 2018 .
The competition version contains 17 , 878 chitchat conversations conditioned on 1 , 155 personas for training and 1 , 000 conversations conditioned on 100 personas for validation .
Base Speakers .
We experiment on three pretrained models including ControlSeq2Seq ( See et al , 2019 ) , TransferTransfo ( Wolf et al , 2019b ) , and Blender as base speakers ( S 0 ) for our self - conscious agents ( S 1 ) .
The ControlSeq2Seq is a Seq2Seq model with attention trained on Twitter dataset ( Miller et al , 2017 ) and finetuned on PersonaChat .
TranferTransfo based on GPT ( Radford et al , 2018 ) is the winner of the ConvAI2 competition in automatic evaluation .
Blender , a recently released generative dialogue model , is the state - of - the - art open - domain chatbot .
Our approach improves these base speakers by ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) .
+ DM is the Distractor Memory .
High scores in Hits@1 , Entail@1 and low scores in Contradict@1 imply better consistency . granting them the sense of self - consciousness .
We defer implementation details to Appendix .
Evaluation Metrics .
For Dialogue NLI , we report three ranking metrics introduced in the original paper : Hits@1 , Entail@1 , and Contradict@1 .
Each metric is the proportion of GT , entailing , and contradictory utterances in the top - 1 candidates returned by the model , respectively .
High scores in Entail@1 and low scores in Contradict@1 indicate better consistency with the persona . 
For PersonaChat , we report Hits@1 , standard F1 score , perplexity and C score , following the Con - vAI2 protocol .
Hits@1 is the accuracy of choosing the ground - truth next - utterance among 20 candidates as the models rank the candidates by perplexity .
The C score is a metric for dialogue consistency , introduced in Madotto et al ( 2019 ) .
It computes pairwise comparison between utterance u and persona sentence p j with a pretrained NLI model .
The NLI model returns 1 , 0 , - 1 for entailment , neutrality , and contradiction , respectively .
We sum the NLI scores across persona sentences per dialogue instance : C ( u ) = j NLI ( u , p j ) .
Results on Dialogue NLI .
Table 3 compares the performance of dialogue agents on the Dialogue NLI evaluation set .
Our self - conscious agent S 1 significantly reduces Contradict@1 scores and increases the Entail@1 along with the Hits@1 accuracy of the literal agents S 0 .
We remind that each entailing candidate shares the same annotated triple as the GT utterance .
In other words , they have similar semantics to the GT utterance and follow the ( Zhang et al , 2018 ) .
C is the consistency score evaluated by a pretrained NLI model ( Madotto et al , 2019 ) .
For TransferTransfo , we use the generative version to calculate Hits@1 . 
given persona .
Thus , Entail@1 is a lenient version of Hits@1 ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) .
The Distractor Memory ( DM ) is better than random distractor selection for S 1 across all metrics .
It concludes that learned distractors are more effective than random distractors for pragmatic agents . 
Results on PersonaChat .
Table 4 compares the performance of different dialogue agents on the PersonaChat dataset .
Our model S 1 outperforms all other generative dialogue agents in terms of consistency related metrics , i.e. Hits@1 and C score .
Since the posterior update of our self - conscious agent revises the distribution learned by the base speaker , the increase in perplexity is natural due to the effect of regularization .
Nevertheless , our approach improves the F1 score for TransferTransfo and Blender .
Thus , being consistent to the given persona can also help improve the generation performance of dialogue agents . 
Comparison with agents that use NLI model .
We also test agents with pretrained NLI models attached ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) , denoted by + NLI in Table 5 .
The NLI model computes contradiction scores of each candidate utterances , and penalize its rank accordingly .
Compared to base agents with no self - consciousness , our agents improve consistency in all three metrics even further when using additional NLI models .
Another notable result is that our agents without NLI ( S 1 + DM in Table 3 ) for ControlSeq2Seq and TransferTransfo even outperform the base agents with NLI ( S 0
+ NLI ) on Hits@1 .
That is , our self - conscious agents achieve better GT accuracy even without the help of an NLI model trained on consistency labels .
We perform human evaluation via Amazon Mechanical Turk .
We random sample 250 test examples , each is rated by three unique human judges in terms of ( i ) Consistency and ( ii ) Engagingness . 
Turkers are shown a given persona , a dialogue context , and the model 's generated utterance .
For consistency , we follow Madotto et al ( 2019 ) and ask judges to assign 1 , 0 , −1 to the utterance for consistency , neutrality , and contradiction , respectively .
Following See et al ( 2019 ) , we evaluate the engagingness of the utterance in a 4 - point scale , where higher scores are better .
To alleviate annotator bias and inter - annotator variability , we apply Bayesian calibration ( Kulikov et al , 2019 ) to the scores .
Table 6 summarizes the human evaluation results .
The agent with our self - consciousness method S 1 is rated as more consistent than the base agent S 0 while maintaining a similar level of engagingness .
While it can be trivial to increase consistency at the cost of engagingness ( e.g. perfect consistency can by generating boring utterances with very little variance ) , it is not the case for our agent .
Since our agent seeks to be heard as the given persona to the listener , self - distinctive words tend to meld into generated responses ( see Figure 6 ) .
Thus , the responses from self - conscious agents have their own color , which can help improving engagingness . 
Figure 4 displays selected examples of utterance generation .
Each example is comprised of dialogue history , human response , and utterances generated by our method and baselines .
We demonstrate that our self - conscious agent can be generalized to generate context - consistent utterances beyond persona .
We condition the agent with its previous responses in the dialogue history ; that is , i in Eq .
( 2 ) is the agent 's past responses instead of persona sentences .
Hence , tokens that are inconsistent to the agent 's past response would be less favored by the model .
Table 7 reports the results of context conditioned self - conscious agents .
The EmpatheticDialogue ( Rashkin et al , 2019 ) is an open - domain dialogue dataset where a speaker describes a past emotional experience and the listener responds accordingly .
Since the speaker 's descriptions should be consistent to the experience and previous utterances , it is a suitable benchmark for consistency .
We model the speaker 's utterances and measure its consistency . 
Our S 1 agent outperforms other literal agents on all three datasets in terms of consistency .
Thus , our approach can also be applied to help agents stay more consistent to its context .
( Zhang et al , 2018 ) .
We compare it with the base speaker ( S 0 ) of TransferTransfo ( Wolf et al , 2019b ) and the human response ( Human ) .
To further analyze our self - conscious agent , we conduct experiments by controlling three features of our agent : world prior updates p t ( i ) , listener rationality β and speaker rationality α .
World Prior Update .
In the self - conscious agent , the world prior acts as a cumulative state over personas .
We remind that we propose to update the world prior with L t 0 instead of L t 1 in Eq .
( 3 ) .
As reported in Cohn - Gordon et al ( 2018 ) , our experiments on the Dialogue NLI dataset confirm the prior update with L t 1 makes little difference in performance compared with using a uniform distribution .
However , our approach with L t 0 makes significant difference , as shown in Figure 5 .
The reason is that the pragmatic listener L t 1 ∝ S t 0
( u t | i , h , u < t ) × L t 0
( i | h , u ≤t , p t ) reflects the current S t 0 twice ( i.e. in L t 0 and in itself ) per time step .
Hence , the update with L t 1 becomes more of an instantaneous prior rather than a cumulative one .
On the other hand , L t 0 moderately combines the information from both S t 0 and p t ( i ) , preserving better cumulative information . 
Listener Rationality β .
We add β in L t 0 to control the amount of information incorporated to the world prior p t ( i ) .
Figure 5 depicts that when β is large , the Hits@1 scores ( i.e. the GT accuracy ) drop .
With a big β , the information S t 0
at current time step overrides the cumulative prior p t ( i ) .
That is , the utterance state evolves shortsightedly , ignoring the context information from the previous steps .
Therefore , setting of β ≤ 1 is advantageous for the self - conscious agent to incrementally decode . 
Speaker Rationality α .
Figure 6 shows an example of how generated responses vary according to the intensity of speaker rationality α .
As α increases , the self - conscious agent reflects the listener 's distribution ( i.e. the likelihood ) more into the posterior .
When α is too large , the posterior distribution is overwhelmed by the likelihood of the persona .
Then , the language model degenerates to favor uttering fragments of the given persona while even ignoring the syntax .
Hence , α can control the degree of copying the given condition text .
An appropriate α value allows the given persona condition to blend smoothly in the utterance .
This work investigated how modeling public selfconsciousness can help dialogue agents improve persona - consistency .
We showed existing dialogue agents are highly insensitive to contradiction , and introduced an orthogonally applicable method using the RSA framework ( Frank and Goodman , 2012 ) to alleviate the issue .
We also designed a 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3 . learning method for distractor selection , named Distractor Memory and proposed a better update for the listener 's world prior .
Furthermore , we demonstrated how our approach can be generalized to improve dialogue context - consistency .
Our self - conscious agents improved the base agents on the Dialogue NLI ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) and PersonaChat ( Zhang et al , 2018 ) dataset , without consistency labels and NLI models .
An important future direction will be generating the distractors and learning the rationality coefficients . 
A Results on Variants of Distractor Selection ( Section 4.2 ) ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) . 
We compare our proposed Distractor Memory ( DM ) with three heuristic methods , and two variants of the pretrained BERT model ( Devlin et al , 2019 ) .
As a straightforward baseline , we randomly select k personas from training set and directly use it as distractors .
Second , we test the k - nearest search by speaker 's persona , denoted by Nearest ; for a given persona descriptions , we find its closest training persona embedding using cosine similarity on average pooled BERT features .
The third baseline denoted by Farthest is to find the k - farthest persona among the training personas . 
We also compare with two variants of the BERT model .
The first variant is BERT - Classifier , which takes dialogue context as input and returns the index of persona from training set as output .
The second variant is bi - encoder ranking model of Miller et al ( 2017 ) , denoted by BERT - Ranker .
It encodes dialogue context and candidate persona with separate BERT encoders measuring its ranking with cosine similarity .
For both methods , we use top - k ranked personas as distractors and set k = 4 for all the methods .
We use Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) with learning rate 2e - 5 and finetune BERT - Uncased - Base up to 3 epochs . 
Table 8 compares the performance of different distractor selecting methods on the Dialogue NLI evaluation set ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) .
We set α = 8 , β = 0.5 , and | I | = 5 .
The DM model outperforms all the baselines across all metrics .
The Farthest shows better performance than the Nearest .
It can be understood that dissimilar distractors are more effective in the Rational Speech Acts framework ( Frank and Goodman , 2012 ) .
The BERT - Ranker performs the best among baselines , but not as good as ours , which validates that memorization capability is effective for selecting useful distractors .
Base Codes and Datasets .
We use the ParlAI framework 2 ( Miller et al , 2017 ) and Hugging - Face 's Transformers 3 ( Wolf et al , 2019a ) to implement our models and baselines .
We use Dialogue NLI ( Welleck et al , 2019 ) and PersonaChat ( Zhang et al , 2018 ) datasets from the ParlAI framework as is .
We use the default preprocessing in ParlAI . Training .
Our self - consciousness approach improves consistency for any pretrained dialogueagents without additional consistency labels and pretrained NLI models .
Since it post - processes the output probability of pretrained dialogue - agents in a Bayesian fashion , no additional model parameters are added to the dialogue agents .
Thus , it does not require any training .
In the case of using the Distractor Memory ( DM ) , first we initialize BERT - Uncased - Base with pretrained weights and finetune it up to 3 epochs with Adam optimizer with learning rate 2e - 5 .
Then we find the best distractor persona for each model and use those labels to train our DM .
We train our DM on one NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU up to 7 epochs . 
Hyperparameters .
For Dialogue NLI evaluation , we set the speaker rationality α = 8.0 , the listener rationality β
= 1.0 , and the cardinality of the world I to 3 .
In PersonaChat evaluation , we set α = 2.0 , β = 0.3 for ControlSeq2Seq
( See et al , 2019 ) , α = 2 , β = 0.9 for TransferTransfo ( Wolf et al , 2019b ) , and α = 2.0 , β = 0.5 for Blender 90 M .
We also set |
I | = 3 .
We experiment α = { 1.0 , 2.0 , 4.0 , 8.0 , 16.0 } , β = { 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.9 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 4.0 } , and | I | = { 2 , 3 , 5 } .
We choose the hyper - parameter configuration showing the best performance in Hits@1 for Dialogue NLI and F1 score for PersonaChat .
The posterior distribution of our self - conscious agents are computed deterministically .
For our Distractor Memory , we set the memory key matrix as K R m×d , where m = 16000 and d = 768 .
We set the number of nearest neighbor k = 2048 . Inference .
We use greedy decoding for all methods .
The average runtime for our self - conscious approach is dependent on the base dialogue agents and the cardinality of world I which can be run in parallel like beam search . 
Evaluation .
We follow the evaluation of the Par - lAI framework .
Following Madotto et al ( 2019 ) , 2 https://parl.ai/ 3 https://huggingface.co/transformers/ we use the finetuned BERT - based NLI model 4 to compute the C score .
Figure 7 shows selected examples of generated responses .
In each set , we show given persona , dialogue context , human responses , and generated responses by our self - conscious agent and the base speaker .
We use TransferTransfo ( Wolf et al , 2019b ) as a base speaker .

 [ P1 ] I really enjoy shopping and my dream is to one day own a Rolls Royce ghost . 
[ P2 ]
Wow .
I enjoy running over driving . 
[ P1 ] Running is also quite lovely .
Breathing in the lovely outside air . 
[ P2 ] Yes it is .
It clears my head when I need to as well . 
( S 1 + DM ) shopping is a great way to clear my head .
( S 0 )
i love to shop and watch movies .
( Human ) yes , and it also helps with depression i have found . 
Figure 7 : Examples of generated responses by our self - conscious agent with Distractor Memory ( S 1 + DM ) on the PersonaChat dataset ( Zhang et al , 2018 ) .
We compare it with the base speaker ( S 0 ) of TransferTransfo ( Wolf et al , 2019b ) and the human response ( Human ) .
