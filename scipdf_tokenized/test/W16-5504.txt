X575 : writing rengas with web services
Our software system simulates the classical collaborative Japanese poetry form , renga , made of linked haikus .
We used NLP methods wrapped up as web services .
This approach is suitable for collaborative human - AI generation , as well as purely computer - generated poetry .
Evaluation included a blind survey comparing AI and human haiku .
To gather ideas for future work , we examine related research in semiotics , linguistics , and computing .
Computer haikus have been explored in practice at least since Lutz ( 1959 ) .
More recently , haikus have been used by Ventura ( 2016 ) as the testbed for a thought experiment on levels of computational creativity .
As we will discuss below , the classic haiku traditionally formed the starting verse of a longer poetry jam , resulting in a poem called a renga .
A computational exploration of renga writing allows us to return to some of the classical ideas in Japanese poetry via thoroughly modern ideas like concept blending and collaborative AI . 
Ventura 's creative levels range from randomisation to plagiarisation , memorisation , generalisation , filtration , inception 1 and creation .
Further gradations and criteria could be advanced , for example , the fitness function used for filtration could be developed and refined as the system learns .
Creativity might be assessed in a social context , as we investigate how a system collaborates . 
While self - play was a good way for the recently developed board game - playing system AlphaGo to transcend its training data ( Silver et al , 2016 ) , we do not yet have computationally robust qualitative evaluation measures for the poetry domain , where there is no obvious " winning condition . "
We began by creating a program for generating haikus , trained on a small corpus .
Our technical aim then was to simulate the collaborative creation of renga , i.e. , linked haikus .
There are several forms of renga with varying constraints ( Carley , 2015 ) , for example the 20 stanza " Nijiun " renga which alternates between twoline and three - line verses , with a focus on seasonal symbolism and rules against repetition .
2 Our initial effort was a technical success , however the rengas we produced fail to fully satisfy classical constraints .
A subsequent experiment is more convincing in this regard , but still leaves room for improvement .
Our discussion considers the aesthetics of the generated poems and outlines directions for future research .
Coleridge considered poetry to be " the blossom and the fragrance of all human knowledge . "
AI researcher Ruli Manurung defines poetry somewhat more drily : " A poem is a natural language artefact which simultaneously fulfils the properties of meaningfulness , grammaticality and poeticness " ( Manurung , 2004 , p. 8 ) . 
The haiku as we know it was originally called hokku - 発句 , literally the " starting verse " of a collaboratively written poem , hakai no renga .
Typically each of following links in a renga take the familiar 5/7/5 syllable form .
Classical rengas vary in length from two to 100 links ( and , rarely , even 1000 ) .
The starting verse is traditionally comprised of two images , with a kireji - a sharp cut - between them .
The term haiku introduced by the 19th Century poet Masaoka Shiki supersedes the older term .
Stylistically , a haiku captures a moment . 
In classical renga , all of the verses after the first have additional complex constraints , such as requiring certain images to be used at certain points , but disallowing repetition , with various proximity constraints .
The setting in which rengas were composed is also worth commenting on .
A few poets would compose together in party atmosphere , with one honoured guest proposing the starting haiku , then the next responding , and continuing in turn , subject to the oversight of a scribe and a renga master .
These poetry parties were once so popular and time consuming that they were viewed as a major decadence .
Jin'Ichi
et al ( 1975 ) offers a useful overview . 
Because of the way we 've constructed our haiku generating system , it can take an entire haiku as its input topic - we just add the word vectors to make a topic model - and compose a response .
This affords AI - to - AI collaboration , or AI - human collaboration .
It can also blend two inputs - for example , the previous haiku and the current constraint from the renga ruleset ( e.g. , the requirement to allude to " cherry blossoms " or " the moon " ) .
Working with a small haiku corpus , we used a POS tagger to reveal the grammatical structure typical to haikus .
The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary is used to count syllables of words that fill in this structure .
3
The Brown corpus was used to generate n - grams , and the generation process prefers more common constructions in haikus .
4 Wikipedia data was processed with GloVe ( Pennington et al , 2014 ) to create a semantic vector space model of topics , based on word co - occurrences .
5
Adding a web API turned the haiku generating system into a haiku server , and facilitated subsequent work with FloWr .
In short : ( 1 ) whether a given haiku makes sense and how well it fits the topic , ( 2 ) whether it fits the form , i.e. , is it a valid haiku ? , and ( 3 ) , the beauty of the writing , the emotion it evokes .
Details of a surveybased blind comparison of human and computerwritten haikus were written up by Aji ( 2015 ) .
The system was then extended with multiple inputs , in some cases producing interesting blends : e.g. , the following in response to " frog pond " and " moon " : that gull in the dressvivacious in statue from so many ebbs II .
Generation of rengas Here are two rengas generated by wrapping the haiku API inside the FloWr flowchart system ( Charnley et al , 2016
In each case , the prompt for the first link is " flower blossom " and each link is passed on to the next link along with a secondary prompt .
The secondary links are " moon , " " autumn , " and " love , " respectively .
For the first renga , we designed a flowchart that selects the " most positive " haiku from the ten that the haiku API returns , using the AFINN word list .
6 In the second renga , we designed a flowchart to select the haiku with the lowest word variety ( computed in terms of Levenshtein distance ) .
We made improvements to the use of the Brown corpus to utilise n - grams for word - flow and sense , as well as tuning the weightings given to sense and topic .
We implemented the injection of topics via by blending , as per classical constraints ( e.g. , required seasonal themes like " winter , " or " flowers " in the penultimate link ) .
At left , we quote the closing links of the first Nijiun renga generated by our software .
Towards automated evaluation Some aspects of the evaluation dimensions are built into the way the poems are constructed .
Form : the haiku - generating subsystem guarantees that the requirements of a grammatical skeleton are met , and the 5/7/5 syllable pattern is guaranteed ( up to the accuracy of the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary ) .
Surface form scales up well for rengas . 
Sense : the haiku generating subsystem uses an ngram model of text likelihood , which will yield a higher score for constructions that match frequently observed phrases .
In our first round of experiments with rengas , sense tended to degrade quickly .
Our subsequent adaptations to the renga generation algorithm prioritise greater continuitity between links . 
Topic : we used a vector model of the topic word ( s ) , and can measure the distance to the vector given by the sum of the words in the poem . 
Emotion :
In our experiment with FloWr , we used a quite simple method , filtering a list for the " most positive " haikus .
Mohammad ( 2016 ) surveys more recent work in NLP on modelling emotion , which could be exploited in future work . 
Beauty : Waugh ( 1980 ) points out that language is based on a " hierarchy of signs . .
.
of ascending complexity , but also one of ascending freedom or creativity , " and also remarks that a " poem provides its own ' universe of discourse . ' "
To some extent these criteria pull in opposite directions : towards complexity , and towards coherence , respectively .
Our first rengas could not be reasonably described as a ' universe of discourse ' but rather , a ' universe of random nonsense ' .
This is improved in the subsequent experiment .
Traditional rengas forbid repetition , and discourage overt reflection on themes like death , war , illness , impermanence , religion and sex ( Carley , 2015 ) .
Thus , despite being coherent , the repetitive " military " theme in the final example above is not appropriate to classical constraints .
A reader may identify some fortuitous resonances , e.g. , " the flower war " is interesting within the " afghan " context established in earlier links - but the system itself does not yet recognise these features .
Some paths forward Wiggins and Forth ( 2015 ) use hierarchical models in a system that builds a formative evaluation as it composes or reads sentences , judging how well they match learned patterns .
While this seems to have more to do with constraints around typicality , per Waugh , there is room for creativity within hierarchies .
Hoey ( 2005 ) makes a convincing argument that satisfying lexical constraints while violating some familiar patterns may come across as interesting and creative . 
Word similarities can be found using GloVe : this would presumably produce links with more coherent meanings , compared to the edit distance - based measure we used .
Ali Javaheri Javid et al ( 2016 ) use information gain to model the aesthetics of cellular automata .
Can these ideas be combined to model evolving topic salience , complexity , and coherence ? 
If the system provided a razo ( the troubadours ' jargon for " rationale " ; see Agamben ( 1999 , p. 79 ) ) , we could debug that , and perhaps involve additional AI systems in the process ( Corneli et al , 2015 ) .
In terms of Ventura 's hierarchy of creative levels , the haiku system appears to be in the " generalisation " stage .
Our renga - writing experiments with FloWr brought in a " filtration " aspect .
The research themes discussed above point to directions for future work in pursuit of the " inception " and " creativity " stages . 
Some previous work with haiku , e.g. Netzer et al ( 2009 ) and Rzepka and Araki ( 2015 ) , have addressed the problem of meaning .
The renga form brings these issues to the fore .
We hope this early work has motivated further interest in this challenging and enjoyable poetic form that - like other less constrained forms of dialogue - combines themes of natural language generation and understanding .
One natural next step would be a series of experiments in collaborative human - AI generation of rengas .
Our haiku software is available for future experiments .
