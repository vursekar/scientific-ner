UDapter : Language Adaptation for Truly Universal Dependency Parsing
Recent advances in multilingual dependency parsing have brought the idea of a truly universal parser closer to reality . However , crosslanguage interference and restrained model capacity remain major obstacles . To address this , we propose a novel multilingual task adaptation approach based on contextual parameter generation and adapter modules . This approach enables to learn adapters via language embeddings while sharing model parameters across languages . It also allows for an easy but effective integration of existing linguistic typology features into the parsing network . The resulting parser , UDapter , outperforms strong monolingual and multilingual baselines on the majority of both high - resource and lowresource ( zero - shot ) languages , showing the success of the proposed adaptation approach . Our in - depth analyses show that soft parameter sharing via typological features is key to this success . 1
Monolingual training of a dependency parser has been successful when relatively large treebanks are available ( Kiperwasser and Goldberg , 2016 ; Dozat and Manning , 2017 ) . However , for many languages , treebanks are either too small or unavailable . Therefore , multilingual models leveraging Universal Dependency annotations ( Nivre et al , 2018 ) have drawn serious attention ( Zhang and Barzilay , 2015 ; Ammar et al , 2016 ; Kondratyuk and Straka , 2019 ) . Multilingual approaches learn generalizations across languages and share information between them , making it possible to parse a target language without supervision in that language . Moreover , multilingual models can be faster to train and easier to maintain than a large set of monolingual models . However , scaling a multilingual model over a high number of languages can lead to sub - optimal results , especially if the training languages are typologically diverse . Often , multilingual neural models have been found to outperform their monolingual counterparts on low - and zero - resource languages due to positive transfer effects , but underperform for high - resource languages ( Johnson et al , 2017 ; Arivazhagan et al , 2019 ; Conneau et al , 2020 ) , a problem also known as " the curse of multilinguality " . Generally speaking , a multilingual model without language - specific supervision is likely to suffer from over - generalization and perform poorly on high - resource languages due to limited capacity compared to the monolingual baselines , as verified by our experiments on parsing . In this paper , we strike a good balance between maximum sharing and language - specific capacity in multilingual dependency parsing . Inspired by recently introduced parameter sharing techniques ( Platanios et al , 2018 ; Houlsby et al , 2019 ) , we propose a new multilingual parser , UDapter , that learns to modify its language - specific parameters including the adapter modules , as a function of language embeddings . This allows the model to share parameters across languages , ensuring generalization and transfer ability , but also enables language - specific parameterization in a single multilingual model . Furthermore , we propose not to learn language embeddings from scratch , but to leverage a mix of linguistically curated and predicted typological features as obtained from the URIEL language typology database which supports 3718 languages including all languages represented in UD . While the importance of typological features for cross - lingual parsing is known for both non - neural ( Naseem et al , 2012 ; Zhang and Barzilay , 2015 ) and neural approaches ( Ammar et al , 2016 ; Scholivet et al , 2019 ) , we are the first to use them effectively as direct input to a neural parser , without manual selection , over a large number of languages in the context of zero - shot parsing where gold POS labels are not given at test time . In our model , typological features are crucial , leading to a substantial LAS increase on zero - shot languages and no loss on high - resource languages when compared to the language embeddings learned from scratch . We train and test our model on the 13 syntactically diverse high - resource languages that were used by Kulmizev et al ( 2019 ) , and also evaluate it on 30 genuinely low - resource languages . Results show that UDapter significantly outperforms stateof - the - art monolingual ( Straka , 2018 ) and multilingual ( Kondratyuk and Straka , 2019 ) parsers on most high - resource languages and achieves overall promising improvements on zero - shot languages . Contributions We conduct several experiments on a large set of languages and perform thorough analyses of our model . Accordingly , we make the following contributions : 1 ) We apply the idea of adapter tuning ( Rebuffi et al , 2018 ; Houlsby et al , 2019 ) to the task of universal dependency parsing . 2 ) We combine adapters with the idea of contextual parameter generation ( Platanios et al , 2018 ) , leading to a novel language adaptation approach with state - of - the art UD parsing results . 3 ) We provide a simple but effective method for conditioning the language adaptation on existing typological language features , which we show is crucial for zero - shot performance .
This section presents the background of our approach . Multilingual Neural Networks Early models in multilingual neural machine translation ( NMT ) designed dedicated architectures ( Dong et al , 2015 ; Firat et al , 2016 ) whilst subsequent models , from Johnson et al ( 2017 ) onward , added a simple language identifier to the models with the same architecture as their monolingual counterparts . More recently , multilingual NMT models have focused on maximizing transfer accuracy for low - resource language pairs , while preserving high - resource language accuracy ( Platanios et al , 2018 ; Neubig and Hu , 2018 ; Aharoni et al , 2019 ; Arivazhagan et al , 2019 ) , known as the ( positive ) transfer - ( negative ) interference trade - off . Another line of work builds massively multilingual pre - trained language mod - els to produce contextual representation to be used in downstream tasks ( Devlin et al , 2019 ; Conneau et al , 2020 ) . As the leading model , multilingual BERT ( mBERT ) 2 ( Devlin et al , 2019 ) which is a deep self - attention network , was trained without language - specific signals on the 104 languages with the largest Wikipedias . It uses a shared vocabulary of 110 K WordPieces ( Wu et al , 2016 ) , and has been shown to facilitate cross - lingual transfer in several applications ( Pires et al , 2019 ; Wu and Dredze , 2019 ) . Concurrently to our work , Pfeiffer et al ( 2020 ) have proposed to combine language and task adapters , small bottleneck layers ( Rebuffi et al , 2018 ; Houlsby et al , 2019 ) , to address the capacity issue which limits multilingual pre - trained models for cross - lingual transfer . Cross - Lingual Dependency Parsing The availability of consistent dependency treebanks in many languages Nivre et al , 2018 ) has provided an opportunity for the study of cross - lingual parsing . Early studies trained a delexicalized parser ( Zeman and Resnik , 2008 ; on one or more source languages by using either gold or predicted POS labels ( Tiedemann , 2015 ) and applied it to target languages . Building on this , later work used additional features such as typological language properties ( Naseem et al , 2012 ) , syntactic embeddings ( Duong et al , 2015 ) , and cross - lingual word clusters ( Täckström et al , 2012 ) . Among lexicalized approaches , Vilares et al ( 2016 ) learns a bilingual parser on a corpora obtained by merging harmonized treebanks . Ammar et al ( 2016 ) trains a multilingual parser using multilingual word embeddings , token - level language information , language typology features and fine - grained POS tags . More recently , based on mBERT ( Devlin et al , 2019 ) , zero - shot transfer in dependency parsing was investigated ( Wu and Dredze , 2019 ; Tran and Bisazza , 2019 ) . Finally Kondratyuk and Straka ( 2019 ) trained a multilingual parser on the concatenation of all available UD treebanks . Language Embeddings and Typology Conditioning a multilingual model on the input language is studied in NMT ( Ha et al , 2016 ; Johnson et al , 2017 ) , syntactic parsing ( Ammar et al , 2016 ) and language modeling ( Östling and Tiedemann , 2017 ) . The goal is to embed language information in real - valued vectors in order to enrich internal representations with input language for multilingual models . In dependency parsing , several previous studies ( Naseem et al , 2012 ; Zhang and Barzilay , 2015 ; Ammar et al , 2016 ; Scholivet et al , 2019 ) have suggested that typological features are useful for the selective sharing of transfer information . Results , however , are mixed and often limited to a handful of manually selected features ( Fisch et al , 2019 ; Ponti et al , 2019 ) . As the most similar work to ours , Ammar et al ( 2016 ) uses typological features to learn language embeddings as part of training , by augmenting each input token and parsing action representation . Unfortunately though , this technique is found to underperform the simple use of randomly initialized language embeddings ( ' language IDs ' ) . Authors also reported that language embeddings hurt the performance of the parser in zero - shot experiments ( Ammar et al , 2016 , footnote 30 ) . Our work instead demonstrates that typological features can be very effective if used with the right adaptation strategy in both supervised and zero - shot settings . Finally , Lin et al ( 2019 ) use typological features , along with properties of the training data , to choose optimal transfer languages for various tasks , including UD parsing , in a hard manner . By contrast , we focus on a soft parameter sharing approach to maximize generalizations within a single universal model .
In this section , we present our truly universal dependency parser , UDapter . UDapter consists of a biaffine attention layer stacked on top of the pretrained Transformer encoder ( mBERT ) . This is similar to ( Wu and Dredze , 2019 ; Kondratyuk and Straka , 2019 ) , except that our mBERT layers are interleaved with special adapter layers inspired by Houlsby et al ( 2019 ) . While mBERT weights are frozen , biaffine attention and adapter layer weights are generated by a contextual parameter generator ( Platanios et al , 2018 ) that takes a language embedding as input and is updated while training on the treebanks . Note that the proposed adaptation approach is not restricted to dependency parsing and is in principle applicable to a range of multilingual NLP tasks . We will now describe the components of our model .
The top layer of UDapter is a graph - based biaffine attention parser proposed by Dozat and Manning ( 2017 ) . In this model , an encoder generates an internal representation r i for each word ; the decoder takes r i and passes it through separate feedforward layers ( MLP ) , and finally uses deep biaffine attention to score arcs connecting a head and a tail : h ( head ) i = MLP ( head ) ( r i ) ( 1 ) h ( tail ) i = MLP ( tail ) ( r i ) ( 2 ) s ( arc ) = Biaffine ( H ( head ) , H ( tail ) ) ( 3 ) Similarly , label scores are calculated by using a biaffine classifier over two separate feedforward layers . Finally , the Chu - Liu / Edmonds algorithm ( Chu , 1965 ; Edmonds , 1967 ) is used to find the highest scoring valid dependency tree .
To obtain contextualized word representations , UDapter uses mBERT . For a token i in sentence S , BERT builds an input representation w i composed by summing a WordPiece embedding x i ( Wu et al , 2016 ) and a position embedding f i . Each w i S is then passed to a stacked self - attention layers ( SA ) to generate the final encoder representation r i : w i = x i + f i ( 4 ) r i = SA ( w i ; Θ ( ad ) ) ( 5 ) where Θ ( ad ) denotes the adapter modules . During training , instead of fine - tuning the whole encoder network together with the task - specific top layer , we use adapter modules ( Rebuffi et al , 2018 ; Stickland and Murray , 2019 ; Houlsby et al , 2019 ) , or simply adapters , to capture both task - specific and language - specific information . Adapters are small modules added between layers of a pre - trained network . In adapter tuning , the weights of the original network are kept frozen , whilst the adapters are trained for a downstream task . Tuning with adapters was mainly suggested for parameter efficiency but they also act as an information module for the task or the language to be adapted ( Pfeiffer et al , 2020 ) . In this way , the original network serves as a memory for the language ( s ) . In UDapter , following Houlsby et al ( 2019 ) , two bottleneck adapters with two feedforward projections and a GELU nonlinearity ( Hendrycks and Gimpel , 2016 ) are inserted into each transformer layer as shown in Figure 1 . We apply adapter tuning for two reasons : 1 ) Each adapter module consists of only few parameters and allows to use contextual parameter generation ( CPG ; see 3.3 ) with a reasonable number of trainable parameters . 3 2 ) Adapters enable taskspecific as well as language - specific adaptation via CPG since it keeps backbone multilingual representations as memory for all languages in pre - training , which is important for multilingual transfer . F 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 Biaffine Attention ( for
To control the amount of sharing across languages , we generate trainable parameters of the model using a contextual parameter generator ( CPG ) function inspired by Platanios et al ( 2018 ) . CPG enables UDapter to retain high multilingual quality without losing performance on a single language , during multi - language training . We define CPG as a function of language embeddings . Since we only train adapters and the biaffine attention ( i.e. adapter tuning ) , the parameter generator is formalized as { θ ( ad ) , θ ( bf ) } g ( m ) ( l e ) where g ( m ) denotes the parameter generator with language embedding l e , and θ ( ad ) and θ ( bf ) denote the parameters of adapters and biaffine attention respectively . We implement CPG as a simple linear transform of a language embedding , similar to Platanios et al ( 2018 ) , so that weights of adapters in the encoder and biaffine attention are generated by the dot product of language embeddings : g ( m ) ( l e ) = ( W ( ad ) , W ( bf ) ) l e ( 6 ) 3 Due to CPG , the number of adapter parameters is multiplied by language embedding size , resulting in a larger model compared to the baseline ( more details in Appendix A.1 ) . where l e R M , W ( ad ) R P ( ad ) ×M , W ( bf ) R P ( bf ) ×M , M is the language embedding size , P ( ad ) and P ( bf ) are the number of parameters for adapters and biaffine attention respectively . 4 An important advantage of CPG is the easy integration of existing task or language features .
Soft sharing via CPG enables our model to modify its parsing decisions depending on a language embedding . While this allows UDapter to perform well on the languages in training , even if they are typologically diverse , information sharing is still a problem for languages not seen during training ( zero - shot learning ) as a language embedding is not available . Inspired by Naseem et al ( 2012 ) and Ammar et al ( 2016 ) , we address this problem by defining language embeddings as a function of a large set of language typological features , including syntactic and phonological features . We use a multi - layer perceptron MLP ( lang ) with two feedforward layers and a ReLU nonlinear activation to compute a language embedding l e : l e = MLP ( lang ) ( l t ) ( 7 ) where l t is a typological feature vector for a language consisting of all 103 syntactic , 28 phonological and 158 phonetic inventory features from the URIEL language typology database ( Lewis et al , 2015 ) and Glottolog ( Hammarström et al , 2020 ) . As many feature values are not available for each language , we use the values predicted by using a k - nearest neighbors approach based on average of genetic , geographical and feature distances between languages . For the encoder , we use BERT - multilingualcased together with its WordPiece tokenizer . Since dependency annotations are between words , we pass the BERT output corresponding to the first wordpiece per word to the biaffine parser . We apply the same hyper - parameter settings as Kondratyuk and Straka ( 2019 ) . Additionally , we use 256 and 32 for adapter size and language embedding size respectively . In our approach , pre - trained BERT weights are frozen , and only adapters and biaffine attention are trained , thus we use the same learning rate for the whole network by applying an inverse square root learning rate decay with linear warmup ( Howard and Ruder , 2018 ) . Appendix A.1 gives the hyper - parameter details . Baselines We compare UDapter to the current state of the art in UD parsing : [ 1 ] UUparser+BERT ( Kulmizev et al , 2019 ) , a graph - based BLSTM parser ( de Lhoneux et al , 2017 ; Smith et al , 2018 ) using mBERT embeddings as additional features . [ 2 ] UDpipe ( Straka , 2018 ) , a monolingually trained multi - task parser that uses pretrained word embeddings and character representations . [ 3 ] UDify ( Kondratyuk and Straka , 2019 ) , the mBERTbased multi - task UD parser on which our UDapter is based , but originally trained on all language treebanks from UD . UDPipe scores are taken from Kondratyuk and Straka ( 2019 ) . To enable a direct comparison , we also re - train UDify on our set of 13 high - resource languages both monolingually ( one treebank at a time ; monoudify ) and multilingually ( on the concatenation of languages ; multi - udify ) . Finally , we evaluate two variants of our model : 1 ) Adapter - only has only task - specific adapter modules and no languagespecific adaptation , i.e. no contextual parameter generator ; and 2 ) UDapter - proxy is trained without typology features : a separate language embedding is learnt from scratch for each in - training language , and for low - resource languages we use one from the same language family , if available , as proxy representation . Importantly , all baselines are either trained for a single language , or multilingually without any language - specific adaptation . By comparing UDapter to these parsers , we highlight its unique character that enables language specific parameterization by typological features within a multilingual framework for both supervised and zero - shot learning setup .
Overall , UDapter outperforms the monolingual and multilingual baselines on both high - resource and zero - shot languages . Below , we elaborate on the detailed results . High - resource Languages Labelled Attachement Scores ( LAS ) on the high - resource set are given in Table 1 . UDapter consistently outperforms both our monolingual and multilingual baselines in all languages , and beats the previous work , setting a new state of the art , in 9 out of 13 languages . Statistical significance testing 8 applied between UDapter and multi / mono - udify confirms that UDapter 's performance is significantly better than the baselines in 11 out of 13 languages ( all except en and it ) . Among directly comparable baselines , multiudify gives the worst performance in the typologically diverse high - resource setting . This multilingual model is clearly worse than its monolingually trained counterparts mono - udify : 83.0 vs 86.0 . This result resounds with previous findings in multilingual NMT ( Arivazhagan et al , 2019 ) and highlights the importance of language adaptation even when using high - quality sentence representations like those produced by mBERT . To understand the relevance of adapters , we also evaluate a model which has almost the same architecture as multi - udify except for the adapter modules and the tuning choice ( frozen mBERT weights ) . Interestingly , this adapter - only model considerably outperforms multi - udify ( 85.0 vs 83.0 ) , indicating that adapter modules are also effective in multilingual scenarios . Finally , UDapter achieves the overall best results , with consistent gains over both multi - udify and adapter - only , showing the importance of linguistically informed adaptation even for in - training languages . Low - Resource Languages Average LAS on the 30 low - resource languages are shown in column lr - avg of Table 1 . Overall , UDapter slightly outperforms the multi - udify baseline ( 36.5 vs 36.3 ) , which shows the benefits of our approach on both in - training and zero - shot languages . For a closer look , Table 2 provides individual results for the 18 representative languages in our low - resource set . Here we find a mixed picture : UDapter outperforms multi - udify on 13 out of 18 languages 9 . Achieving improvements in the zero - shot parsing 9 LAS scores for all 30 languages are given in Appendix A.2 . By significance testing , UDapter is significantly better than multi - udify on 16/30 low - resource languages , which is shown in setup is very difficult , thus we believe this result is an important step towards overcoming the problem of positive / negative transfer trade - off . Indeed , UDapter - proxy results show that choosing a proxy language embedding from the same language family underperforms UDapter , apart from not being available for many languages . This indicates the importance of typological features in our approach ( see 5.2 for further analysis ) .
In this section , we further analyse UDapter to understand its impact on different languages , and the importance of its various components .
Figure 2 presents the LAS gain of UDapter over the multi - udify baseline for each high - resource language along with the respective treebank training size . To summarize , the gains are higher for languages with less training data . This suggests that in UDapter , useful knowledge is shared among intraining languages , which benefits low resource languages without hurting high resource ones . For zero - shot languages , the difference between the two models is small compared to high - resource languages ( +1.2 LAS ) . While it is harder to find a trend here , we notice that UDapter is typically beneficial for the languages not present in the mBERT training corpus : it outperforms multi - udify in 13 out of 22 ( non - mBERT ) languages . This suggests that typological feature - based adaptation leads to improved sentence representations when the pretrained encoder has not been exposed to a language .
UDapter learns language embeddings from syntactic , phonological and phonetic inventory features . A natural alternative to this choice is to learn language embeddings from scratch . For a comparison , we train a model where , for each in - training language , a separate language embedding ( of the same size : 32 ) is initialized randomly and learned end - toend . For the zero - shot languages we use the average , or centroid , of all in - training language embeddings . As shown in Figure 4a , on the high - resource set , the models with and without typological features achieve very similar average LAS ( 87.3 and 87.1 respectively ) . On zero - shot languages , however , the use of centroid embedding performs very poorly : 9.0 vs 36.5 average LAS score over 30 languages . As already discussed in 4.1 ( Table 2 ) , using a proxy language embedding belonging to the same family as the test language , when available , also clearly underperforms UDapter . These results confirm our expectation that a model can learn reliable language embeddings for in - training languages , however typological signals are required to obtain a robust parsing quality on zero - shot languages .
We start by analyzing the projection weights assigned to different typological features by the first layer of the language embedding network ( see eq . 7 ) . Figure 4b shows the averages of normalized syntactic , phonological and phonetic inventory feature weights . Although dependency parsing is a syntactic task , the network does not only utilize syntactic features , as also observed by Lin et al ( 2019 ) , but exploits all available typological features to learn its representations . Next , we plot the language representations learned in UDapter by using t - SNE ( van der Maaten and Hinton , 2008 ) , which is similar to the analysis carried out by Ponti et al ( 2019 , figure 8 ) using the language vectors learned by Malaviya et al ( 2017 ) . Figure 5 illustrates 2D vector spaces generated for the typological feature vectors l t ( A ) and the language embeddings l e learned by UDapter with or without typological features ( B and C respectively ) . The benefits of using typological features can be understood by comparing A and B : During training , UDapter learns to project URIEL features to language embeddings in a way that is optimal for in - training language parsing quality . This leads to a different placement of the high - resource languages ( red points ) in the space , where many linguistic similarities are preserved ( e.g. Hebrew and Arabic ; European languages except Basque ) but others are overruled ( Japanese drifting away from Korean ) . Looking at the low - resource languages ( blue points ) we find that typologically similar languages tend to have similar embeddings to the closest highresource language in both A and B. In fact , most groupings of genetically related languages , such as the Indian languages ( hi - cluster ) or the Uralic ones ( fi - cluster ) are largely preserved across these two spaces . Comparing B and C where language embeddings are learned from scratch , the absence of typological features leads to a seemingly random space with no linguistic similarities ( e.g. Arabic far away from Hebrew , Korean closer to English than to Japanese , etc . ) and , therefore , no principled way to represent additional languages . Taken together with the parsing results of 4.1 , these plots suggest that UDapter embeddings strike a good balance between a linguistically motivated representation space and one solely optimized for in - training language accuracy .
In section 4.1 we observed that adapter tuning alone ( that is , without CPG ) improved the multilingual baseline in the high - resource languages , but worsened it considerably in the zero - shot setup . By contrast , the addition of CPG with typological features led to the best results over all languages . But could we have obtained similar results by simply increasing the adapter size ? For instance , in multilingual MT , increasing overall model capacity of an already very large and deep architecture can be a powerful alternative to more sophisticated parameter sharing approaches ( Arivazhagan et al , 2019 ) . To answer this question we train another adapteronly model with doubled size ( 2048 instead of the 1024 used in the main experiments ) . As seen in 3a , increase in model size brings a slight gain to the high - resource languages , but actually leads to a small loss in the zero - shot setup . This shows that adapters enlarge the per - language capacity for in - training languages , but at the same time they hurt generalization and zero - shot transfer . By contrast , UDapter including CPG which increases the model size by language embeddings ( see Appendix A.1 for details ) , outperforms both adapter - only models , confirming once more the importance of this component . For our last analysis ( Fig . 3b ) , we study soft parameter sharing via CPG on different portions of the network , namely : only on the adapter modules ' cpg ( adapters ) ' versus on both adapters and biaffine attention ' cpg ( adap.+biaf . ) ' corresponding to the full UDapter . Results show that most of the gain in the high - resource languages is obtained by only applying CPG on the multilingual encoder . On the other hand , for the low - resource languages , typological feature based parameter sharing is most important in the biaffine attention layer . We leave further investigation of this result to future work .
We have presented UDapter , a multilingual dependency parsing model that learns to adapt languagespecific parameters on the basis of adapter modules ( Rebuffi et al , 2018 ; Houlsby et al , 2019 ) and the contextual parameter generation ( CPG ) method ( Platanios et al , 2018 ) which is in principle applicable to a range of multilingual NLP tasks . While adapters provide a more general tasklevel adaptation , CPG enables language - specific adaptation , defined as a function of language embeddings projected from linguistically curated typological features . In this way , the model retains high per - language performance in the training data and achieves better zero - shot transfer . UDapter , trained on a concatenation of typologically diverse languages ( Kulmizev et al , 2019 ) , outperforms strong monolingual and multilingual baselines on the majority of both high - resource and low - resource ( zero - shot ) languages , which reflects its strong balance between per - language capacity and maximum sharing . Finally , the analyses we performed on the underlying characteristics of our model show that typological features are crucial for zero - shot languages . ( Kondratyuk and Straka , 2019 ) for all low - resource languages . ' * ' shows languages not present in mBERT training data . Additionally , ( † ) indicates languages where no significant difference between UDapter and multi - udify by significance testing . For udapter - proxy , chosen proxy language is given between brackets . CTR means centroid language embedding . models are trained separately so the total number of parameters for 13 languages is 2.5B ( 13x191 M ) .
Table 4 shows LAS scores on all 30 low - resouce languages for UDapter , original UDify ( Kondratyuk and Straka , 2019 ) , and re - trained ' multiudify ' . Languages with ' * ' are not included in mBERT training data . Note that original UDify is trained on all available UD treebanks from 75 languages . For the zero - shot languages , we obtained original UDify scores by running the pre - trained model .
