How Do We Answer Complex Questions : Discourse Structure of Long - form Answers
Long - form answers , consisting of multiple sentences , can provide nuanced and comprehensive answers to a broader set of questions . To better understand this complex and understudied task , we study the functional structure of long - form answers collected from three datasets , ELI5 ( Fan et al , 2019 ) , We - bGPT ( Nakano et al , 2021 ) and Natural Questions ( Kwiatkowski et al , 2019 ) . Our main goal is to understand how humans organize information to craft complex answers . We develop an ontology of six sentence - level functional roles for long - form answers , and annotate 3.9k sentences in 640 answer paragraphs . Different answer collection methods manifest in different discourse structures . We further analyze model - generated answers - finding that annotators agree less with each other when annotating model - generated answers compared to annotating human - written answers . Our annotated data enables training a strong classifier that can be used for automatic analysis . We hope our work can inspire future research on discourselevel modeling and evaluation of long - form QA systems . 1
While many information seeking questions can be answered by a short text span , requiring a short span answer significantly limits the types of questions that can be addressed as well as the extent of information that can be conveyed . Recent work ( Fan et al , 2019 ; Krishna et al , 2021 ; Nakano et al , 2021 ) explored long - form answers , where answers are free - form texts consisting of multiple sentences . Such long - form answers provide flexible space where the answerer can provide a nuanced answer , incorporating their confidence and sources of their knowledge . Thus the answer sentences form a discourse where the answerers provide information , hedge , explain , provide examples , point to other sources , and more ; these elements need to be structured and organized coherently . We take a linguistically informed approach to understand the structure of long - form answers , designing six communicative functions of sentences in long - form answers ( which we call roles ) . 2 Our framework combines functional structures with the notion of information salience by designating a role for sentences that convey the main message of an answer . Other roles include signaling the organization of the answer , directly answering the question , giving an example , providing background information , and so on . About a half of the sentences in long - form answers we study serve roles other than providing an answer to the question . We collect discourse annotations on three long - form question answering ( LFQA ) datasets , ELI5 ( Fan et al , 2019 ) , WebGPT ( Nakano et al , 2021 ) and Natural Questions ( NQ ) ( Kwiatkowski et al , 2019 ) . Figure 1 contains an example annotation on each dataset . While all three contain paragraph - length answers needed for complex queries , they are collected in distinct mannersanswers in ELI5 are written by Reddit users ; answers in WebGPT are written by annotators who searched documents on a web interface and heavily quoted those documents to form an answer , and answers in NQ are pre - existing paragraphs from Wikipedia corpus . We collect three - way annotations for 3.9k sentences ( âˆ¼700 question - answer pairs across three datasets ) . We also annotate a small number of model - generated answers from a recent long - form question answering ( LFQA ) system ( Krishna et al , 2021 ) and provide rich analysis of their discourse structure . In all three datasets , we observe appearance of most proposed functional roles , but with different proportions . Answers in ELI5 contains more examples and elaborations , while answers extracted WebGPT : How much money is needed in order to not have to work for the rest of your life ? I worked on a window - washing robot that cleaned acres of rooftops over a huge commercial greenhouse . Worked great , except when it did n't , and would either break down completely or just get lost and start climbing the wrong parts of the structure . Then repair techs and manual window washers still have to be employed . I think this ends up being a cost / benefit problem where the reliability of our robots and price of implementation is n't quite at the point where it m a k e s t h i s c o m m e r c i a l l y v i a b l e f o r skyscrapers . For what it 's worth , I think the Twin Towers actually used a washer robot on the upper floors to limited success . To determine how much money you need to never have to work again for the rest of your life , some calculation is needed to arrive at a dollar number tailored to you [ 2 ] . You need to consider the amount you spend yearly , the effect of inflation on your savings , and the income you need from an investment portfolio to keep ahead of inflation . [ 1 ] [ 3 ] A reliable savings range is your current yearly spending multiplied by 28 to 36 , with more security and comfort the higher the number is . from Wikipedia passages ( NQ ) contain more auxiliary information . Analyzing a subset of ELI5 and WebGPT , we also identify a big gap in lexical overlap between long - form answer and evidence passages across all functional roles . Lastly , we found that human agreement of the discourse roles of model - generated answers are much lower than human - written ones , reflecting the difficulty for humans to process model - generated answers . With the data collected , we present a competitive role classifier , which performs on par with human when trained with our annotated data and can be used for automatic discourse analysis . We further envision using functional roles for controllable long - form generations , concise answer generation , and improved evaluation metrics for LFQA .
We study the discourse structure of long - form answers based on functional roles of sentences in the paragraph . Functional structures characterize the communicative role a linguistic unit plays ; as such , they vary across genres as the goals of communication also vary . In scientific or technical articles , these roles can be background , method , findings ( Kircz , 1991 ; Liddy , 1991 ; Mizuta et al , 2006 ) , while in news , they can be main event or anecdotes ( Van Dijk , 2013 ; Choubey et al , 2020 ) . These structures are related to , though distinct from , coherence discourse structures ( Hobbs , 1985 ) . The latter characterizes how each unit ( e.g. , adjacent clauses or sentences ) relates to others through semantic relations such as temporal , causal , etc . ; such structures can be trees that hierarchically relate adjacent units ( Mann and Thompson , 1988 ) or graphs ( Lascarides and Asher , 2008 ) . In contrast , functional roles describe how information is organized to serve the communication goal , in our case , providing the answer . We developed our ontology by examining longform answers in online community forums ( subreddit Explain Like I 'm Five ( ELI5 ) ) and Wikipedia passages , hence answers derived from different domains ( e.g. , textbooks ) can contain roles beyond our ontology . We describe our six sentence - level discourse roles for long - form answers here : Answer - Summary ( Sum ) , Answer ( Ans ) . An answer sentence directly addresses the question . Here we distinguish between the the main content of the answer ( henceforth answer summary ) vs. sentences which explain or elaborate on the summary . The summaries play a more salient role than non - summary answer sentences , and can often suffice by themselves as the answer to the question . This is akin to argumentation structure that hierarchically arranges main claims and supporting arguments ( Peldszus and Stede , 2013 ) , and news structure that differentiates between main vs. supporting events ( Van Dijk , 2013 ) . Organizational sentences ( Org . ) Rather than conveying information of the answer , the major role of an organizational sentence is to inform the reader how the answer will be structured . We found two main types of such sentences ; the first signals an upcoming set of items of parallel importance : [ A ] : There are a few reasons candidates with " no chance " to win keep running . 1 ) They enjoy campaigning [ ... ] The other type indicates that part of the answer is upcoming amidst an established flow ; in the example below , the answerer used a hypophora : Examples ( Ex . ) Often people provide examples in answers ; these are linguistically distinct from other answer sentences in the sense that they are more specific towards a particular entity , concept , or situation . This pattern of language specificity can also be found in example - related discourse relations ( Louis and Nenkova , 2011 ; Li and Nenkova , 2015 ) , or through entity instantiation ( MacKinlay and Markert , 2011 ) : [ Q ] : What is it about electricity that kills you ? [ A ] : [ ... ] For example , static electricity consists of tens of thousands of volts , but basically no amps . [ ... ] We found that examples in human answers are often not signaled explicitly , and often contain hypothetical situations : [ Q ] : Were major news outlets established with political bias or was it formed over time ? [ A ] : [ ... ] This is impossible due to the problem of " anchoring . " Consider a world where people on the right want the tax rate to be 1 % lower and people on the left want the tax rate to be 1 % higher [ ... ] Auxiliary information ( Aux . ) These sentences provide information that are related to what is discussed in the answer , but not asked in the question . It could be background knowledge that the answerer deemed necessary or helpful , e.g. , or related content that extends the question , e.g. , [ Q ] : what is the difference between mandi and kabsa ? [ A ] : [ ... ] A popular way of preparing meat is called mandi . [ ... ] Another way of preparing and serving meat for kabsa is mathbi , where seasoned meat is grilled on flat stones that are placed on top of burning embers . Notably , the removal of auxiliary information would still leave the answer itself intact .
We observe various roles that , although less frequent , show up consistently in human answers . We group them into a miscellaneous role and list them below . ( a ) Some sentences specify the limitation of the answer by narrowing down the scope of the answer to an open - ended question . [ Q ] : Why are there such drastic differences in salaries between different countries ? ( b ) Some sentences state where the answer came from and thus put the answer into context . [ Q ] : Why Does a thermostat require the user to switch between heat and cool modes , as opposed to just setting the desired temperature ? [ A ] : The person who installed my heat pump ( which has all three modes ) explained this to me . [ ... ] ( c ) Some sentences point to other resources that might contain the answers . As our ontology does not provide an exhaustive list of the functional roles , we instructed our annotators to annotate other roles not covered by our ontology as Miscellaneous as well .
We randomly sample examples from three LFQA datasets and filter answers with more than 15 sentences and those with less than 3 sentences . 3 We briefly describe each dataset below . 4 ELI5 / ELI5 - model ELI5 consists of QA pairs where the questions and answers are retrieved from the subreddit r / explainlikeimfive . The answers in ELI5 are of varying quality and style . While the original dataset consists of ( question , answer ) pairs , recent benchmark ( Petroni et al , 2021 ) annotated a subset of examples with relevant Wikipedia paragraphs , which we used for analysis in Section 4 . In addition to answers in the original datasets , we annotate a small number of model - generated answers from Krishna et al ( 2021 ) ( we refer this set as ELI5 - model ) , a state - ofthe art LFQA system on ELI5 . WebGPT Nakano et al ( 2021 ) presented a new LFQA dataset and model ; with the goal of building a model that can search and navigate the web to compose a long - form answer . While they reuse questions from ELI5 , they newly collect answers from trained human annotators who were instructed to first search for related documents using a search engine and then construct the answers with reference to those documents . The collected data ( denoted as " human demonstration " consisting of question , answer , a set of evidence documents , and mapping from the answer to the evidence document ) are used to finetune GPT - 3 ( Brown et al , 2020 ) to generate long - form answers . Natural Questions ( NQ ) NQ contains questions from Google search queries , which is paired with a relevant Wikipedia article and an answer in the article if the article answers the question . They annotate paragraph - level answer as well as short span answer inside the paragraph answer if it exists . In open retrieval QA , researchers filtered questions with paragraph level answers for its 3 We used Stanza ( Qi et al , 2020 ) to split long - form answers into sentences . This process removes 42 % , 28 % and 34 % from ELI5 , WebGPT and NQ respectively . 4 Our data is sourced from the validation split of ELI5 from the KILT ( Petroni et al , 2021 ) benchmark , the testing portion from WebGPT ( their samples are publicly hosted at https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows . net / webgpt - answer - viewer / index.html , which answers questions from the ELI5 test set ) , and the validation split from Natural Questions . difficulty of evaluation and only look at questions with short span answer . We create a filtered set of NQ that focuses on paragraph - level answers containing complex queries . 5 While many NQ questions can be answered with a short entity ( e.g. , how many episodes in season 2 breaking bad ? ) , many others questions require paragraph length answer ( e.g. , what does the word china mean in chinese ? ) . This provides a complementary view compared to the other two datasets , as the answers are not written specifically for the questions but harvested from pre - written Wikipedia paragraphs . Thus , this simulates scenarios where model retrieves paragraphs instead of generating them .
We have a two - stage annotation process : annotators first determine the validity of the QA pair , and proceed to discourse annotation only if they consider the QA pair valid . We define the QA pair as valid if ( 1 ) the question is interpretable , ( 2 ) the question does not have presuppositions rejected by the answer , ( 3 ) the question does not contain more than one sub - question , and ( 4 ) the proposed answer properly addresses the question . Examples of the invalid QA pair identified are in A.1 . 6 We collect the first stage annotation from USbased crowdsource workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and second stage annotation from undergraduate students majoring in linguistics , who are native speakers in English . 7 A total of 29 crowdworker participated in our task , and six undergraduates annotated roles for a subset of QA pairs annotated as valid by crowdworkers . We first qualified and then provided training materials to both groups of annotators . The annotation guideline and interface can be found in A.4 . We paid crowd workers $ 0.5 per example , and our undergraduate annotators $ 13 / hour . More details of data collection can be found in our datasheet . ples and role annotations for about half of them .
As our tasks are complex and somewhat subjective , we collected three way annotations . We consider a QA pair valid if all annotated it as valid , and invalid if more than two annotated it as invalid . If two annotators considered valid , we collect one additional annotation and consider it valid if and only if the additional annotator marked it as valid . 8 We consider the majority role ( i.e. chosen by two or more than two annotators ) as the gold label . When all annotators chose different roles , they resolved the disagreement through adjudication . We report inter - annotator agreement before the adjudication . Inter - annotator Agreement We find modest to high agreement for both annotation tasks : For crowdworkers , Fleiss Kappa was 0.51 for validity annotation . For student annotators , Fleiss Kappa was 0.44 for role annotation . Figure 2 shows the confusion matrix between pairs of annotations , with the numbers normalized by row and averaged across pairs of annotators . We observe frequent confusion between roles denoting different levels of information salience - Answer vs. Answer - Summary , and Answer vs. Auxiliary Information , reflecting the nuance and subjectivity in judging what information is necessary to answer a complicated question . Examples can be found in A.2 . 8 The Fleiss kappa for agreement improves to 0.70 after this re - annotation process .
WebGPT
With our annotated data , we study the differences between the three types of long - form answers , namely answers provided by users in online community ( ELI5 ) , answers written by trained annotators through web search ( WebGPT ) , and answers identified in Wikipedia passages ( NQ ) . Q / A Validity Table 2 summarizes the portion of valid answers in the three datasets and the distribution of invalid reasons . NQ has the highest rate of invalid answer ( 15 % ) . Upon manual inspection , we find that passages from Wikipedia written independently of the question often only partially address complex questions . This demonstrates the limitation of a fully extractive approach . Around 10 % of the answers from ELI5 reject presupposition in the question , which is a common phenomena in information - seeking questions . WebGPT boasts the lowest invalid rate , showing the high quality of their collected answers .
We study the distribution of roles in three datasets ( Table 3 ) . NQ shows the highest proportion of auxiliary information , as the paragraphs are written independent of the questions . In contrast , ELI5 contains more answer sentences and examples which provide explanation . Both ELI5 and WebGPT contain organizational sentences , demonstrating that it is commonly used when answerers assemble answers that cover more than one aspects . In all datasets , around half of the sentences serve roles other than directly answering the questions , such as providing auxiliary information or giving an example , which reflects the wide spectrum of information presented in a long - form answer . sentences . This is partially because both datasets are more extractive and less personal , without sentences which serve the role of various kinds of communication from answerers to question askers ( e.g. expressing sentiments , pointing to other resources ) that are commonly seen in online community forum . Discourse Structure Figure 3 presents the distribution of each role per its relative location in the answer . Despite the significant differences in the proportion of different discourse roles , the positioning of the roles is similar across the datasets . Answer summary and organizational sentences typically locate at the beginning of the paragraph , examples and answers often in the middle , with an increasing portion of auxiliary information towards the end . The sentences belonging to miscellaneous role frequently position at the beginning or the end of the paragraph , instead of intervening in the middle . WebGPT contains a higher portion of auxiliary information locating at the beginning of the passage , followed by the answer summary sentences . Answer Extractiveness One important aspect for long - form answer is whether the answer can be attributed to an external evidence document . While answers from NQ are directly extracted from Wikipedia passages , both ELI5 and WebGPT are written specifically for the question . To help with verification , both datasets provide evidence documents paired with the answer , and yet there are design differences between the two . Answerer ( annotators ) of WebGPT were instructed to answer the question based on the evidence documents returned by a search engine , while answers from ELI5 were written first independently and later paired with relevant Wikipedia passages ( Petroni et al , 2021 ) . We found that such difference leads to different level of extractiveness of the answer , by calculating sentence - level lexical overlap ( after removing stopwords ) with the evidence document . Overall , WebGPT answers exhibit more lexical overlap ( unigram : 0.64 , bigram : 0.36 ) with evidence document than ELI5 answers ( unigram : 0.09 , bigram : 0.01 ) . Answer sentences with different roles also exhibit different levels of extractiveness ( detailed role - level overlap can be found in Table 8 in the appendix ) . For ELI5 answers , sentences belonging to answer and summary roles have the highest overlap while example , auxiliary information and miscellaneous sentences are less grounded to external sources . For WebGPT , organizational sentences are the least extractive among all the roles .
Having analyzed discourse roles of human - written long - form answers , we investigate the discourse structure of model - generated answers . This will allow us to quantitatively study the difference in terms of discourse structure across gold and generated answers , which we hope will cast insights to the linguistic quality of system outputs .
We study model - generated answers from a state - of - the - art LFQA system ( Krishna et al , 2021 ) . 9 Their model uses passage retriever ( Guu et al , 2020 ) , and generates answers based on the retrieved passage with a routing transformer model . Q / A Validity We collect validity annotation on 193 model - generated answers , and 78 are considered invalid , significantly higher ratio than that of human written answers ( Table 2 ) . The Fleiss 's kappa of QA pair validity is 0.26 ( and 0.61 after collecting one more label ) , substantially lower than the agreement on human written answers ( 0.51 , 0.70 ) while annotated by the same set of annotators . Detailed distribution of invalid reason annotated can be found in Table 9 . Despite the low agreement , 60 of them are marked as " No valid answer " by at least two annotators . The flaw of automatic measures was also pointed out by prior work ( Krishna et al , 2021 ) , which compares ROUGE between humanwritten and model - generated answers . Our study reiterates that the generated answers received high ROUGE score without answering the question . Roles We proceed to collect sentence - level role annotations on 115 valid generated long - form answers following the same annotation setup in Section 3 , and hence our annotators were not asked to evaluate the correctness or the quality of the answers ( e.g. whether the generated example makes sense ) , focusing on the functional roles of sentences only . We found that the annotators disagree substantially more as compared to the humanwritten answers , with a Fleiss kappa of 0.31 ( vs. 0.45 for human - written answers ) , suggesting that the discourse structure of model - generated answers are less clear , even to our trained annotators . The answer role distribution of model - generated answers is very different from that of the human written answers ( Figure 4 ) . The generated answers contain more sentences which provide auxiliary information , and fewer summary sentences . This suggests that model - generated answers contain a higher portion of information tangentially related to what is asked in the question . Model - generated answers also contain fewer example and miscella - 9 We sampled from four different model configurations reported in their paper , i.e. combination of nucleus sampling threshold p= { 0.6 , 0.9 } , and generation conditioning on { predicted , random } passages . The answers we annotated achieved a ROUGE - L of 23.19 , higher than that of human - written answers on the same set of questions ( 21.28 ) . neous sentences . Examples of annotated modelgenerated answer can be found in Table 10 . Overall , our results suggest that machinegenerated long form answers are different from human - written answers , and judging their discourse structure is nontrivial for human annotators , resulting in lower agreement . Recent study ( Karpinska et al , 2021 ) also showed that expert annotators showed lower agreement and took longer time to evaluate the coherence of story generated from large - scale language model .
We study how models can identify the discourse role for each sentence in long - form answer in a valid QA pair . 10 Such a model can be beneficial for large - scale automatic analysis .
Task and Data Given a question q and its longform answer consisting of sentences s 1 , s 2 ... s n , the goal is to assign each answer sentence s i one of the six roles defined in Section 2 . As we have annotated more examples from ELI5 dataset ( 411 answer paragraphs compared to around 100 paragraphs in other three datasets ( WebGPT , NQ and ELI5 - model ) ) , we randomly split the ELI5 longform answers into train , validation and test sets with a 70%/15%/15 % ratio , and train the model on the training portion . We use all other annotated datasets for evaluation only . For model - generated answers , we filtered 185 out of 1080 sentences where model - generated sentences do not have a majority role . This setup also allows us to study domain transfer of role classification model . Metrics We report accuracy with respect to the majority role label ( or adjudicated one , if majority does n't exist ) ( Acc ) , match on any label from three annotators ( Match ) , F1 score for each role and their macro average score Macro - F1 .
Lower bounds We present two simple baselines to provide lower bounds : ( 1 ) Majority : We predict the most frequent labels in the training data : Answer - Summary . ( 2 ) Summary - lead : We predict first two sentences as Answer - Summary , and the rest of the sentences as Answer . Classification Models This baseline classifies each sentence independently . We use the [ CLS ] token from RoBERTa - Large model ( Liu et al , 2019 ) which encodes [ question < q > ans 1 ... < start > ans i < end > ... ] , where ans i is the i th sentence in the answer . The training batch size is set to 64 , with the initial learning rate as 5e âˆ’ 5 . We used AdamW optimizer and a linear learning rate schedule . We train the model for 10 epochs and report the result of the checkpoint with best validation accuracy , averaged across three random seeds . Seq2Seq Models We use two variations ( base , large ) of T5 model ( Raffel et al , 2020 ) , which take the concatenation of question and answer sentences , and output the roles for each sentence sequentially . This model predicts the roles of all sentences in the answer as a single sequence . The input sequence is [ question [ 1 ] ans 1 [ 2 ] ans 2 ... ] , where ans i denotes the i th sentence in the answer , and the target output sequence is set to [ [ 1 ] role 1 [ 2 ] role 2 [ 3 ] ... ] , where role i is the corresponding role for ans i ( e.g. " Answer " for the Answer role ) . We limit the input / output to be 512/128 tokens . For evaluating the predicted roles , we parse the output string to identify the role predicted for each sentence . We used the batch size of 16 , initial learning rate of 1eâˆ’4 with AdamW optimizer and a linear learning rate schedule . We train the model for 30 epochs and report the result of the checkpoint with the best validation accuracy , averaged across three random seeds . Human performance We provide two approximations for human performance : upperbound ( u ) and lowerbound ( l ) . ( 1 ) Human ( u ) : We compare each individual annotator 's annotation with the majority label . This inflates human performance as one 's own judgement affected the majority label . ( 2 ) Human ( l ) : We compare all pairs of annotation and calculate average F1 and accuracy of all pairs . For Match , we compute the match for each annotation against the other two annotations .
Table 4 reports the results on ELI5 test set . 11 All models outperform the majority and summarylead baselines . The sequential prediction model ( T5 ) significantly outperform classification model ( RoBERTa ) which makes a prediction per sentence . The roles with lower human agreement ( auxiliary , organizational sentence , answer ) also exhibit low model performances , reflecting the subjectivity and ambiguity of roles for some sentences . Overall , with a moderate amount of in - domain annotated data , our best model ( T5 - large ) can reliably classify functional roles of sentences in the long - form answers , showing comparable performances to human lower bound . Table 5 reports the results on the three out - ofdomain datasets , WebGPT , NQ and ELI5 - model ( model - generated answers ) . Human agreement numbers are comparable across all datasets ( 0.53 - 0.59 for lower bound , 0.73 - 0.78 for upper bound ) . While T5 - large still exhibits the best overall performance , all learned models perform worse , partially as the role distribution has changed . Despite trained on the ELI5 dataset , role classification model also perform worse on model - generated answers ( ELI5model ) , echoing our observation that human annotators find it challenging to process the discourse structure of model - generated answers . Our pilot showed that training with in - domain data improved the performances consistently , but the evaluation is on a small subset ( after setting apart some for training ) , so we do not report it here . We anticipate that automatic role classification is feasible given moderate amount of annotation for all three humanwritten long - form answer datasets we study .
Discourse structure . Our work is closely related to functional structures defined through content types explored in other domains ; prior work has affirmed the usefulness of these structures in downstream NLP tasks . In news , Choubey et al ( 2020 ) adopted Van Dijk ( 2013 ) 's content schema cataloging events ( e.g. , main event , anecdotal ) , which they showed to improve the performance of event coreference resolution . In scientific writing , content types ( e.g. , background , methodology ) are shown to be useful for summarization ( Teufel and Moens , 2002 ; Cohan et al , 2018 ) , information extraction ( Mizuta et al , 2006 ; Liakata et al , 2012 ) , and information retrieval ( Kircz , 1991 ; Liddy , 1991 ) . The discourse structure of argumentative texts ( e.g. , support , rebuttal ) ( Peldszus and Stede , 2013 ; Becker et al , 2016 ; Stab and Gurevych , 2017 ) has also been applied on argumentation min - ing . To the best of our knowledge , no prior work has studied the discourse structure of long - form answers . Question Answering . Recent work ( Cao and Wang , 2021 ) have investigated the ontology of questions , which includes comparison questions , verification questions , judgement questions , etc . We construct the ontology of functional roles of answer sentences . One of the roles in our ontology is summary , yielding an extractive summarization dataset . This shares motivation with a line of work studying query - focused summarization ( Xu and Lapata , 2020 ) . Concurrent to our work , Su et al ( 2022 ) studies improving faithfulness of long - form answer through predicting and focusing on salient information in retrieved evidence document . Lastly , our work build up on three datasets containing longform answers ( Kwiatkowski et al , 2019 ; Fan et al , 2019 ; Nakano et al , 2021 ) and extends the analysis of long - form answers from earlier studies ( Krishna et al , 2021 ) .
We present a linguistically motivated study of longform answers . We find humans employ various strategies - introducing sentences laying out the structure of the answer , proposing hypothetical and real examples , and summarizing main points - to organize information . Our discourse analysis characterizes three types of long - form answers and reveals deficient discourse structures of modelgenerated answers . Discourse analysis can be fruitful direction for evaluating long - form answers . For instance , highlighting summary sentence ( s ) or sentence - level discourse role could be helpful for human evaluators to dissect long - form answers , whose length has been found to be challenging for human evaluation ( Krishna et al , 2021 ) . Trained role classifier can also evaluate the discourse structure of model - generated answers . Future work can explore using sentences belonging to the summary role to design evaluation metrics that focuses on the core parts of the answer ( Nenkova and Passonneau , 2004 ) , for assessing the correctness of generated the answer . Exploring controllable generation , such as encouraging models to provide summaries or examples , would be another exciting avenue for future work .
We annotate existing , publicly available long - form question answering datasets which might contain incorrect and outdated information and societal biases . We collected annotations through crowdsourcing platform and also by recruiting undergraduate annotators at our educational institution . We paid a reasonable hourly wage ( $ 13 / hour ) to annotators and documented our data collection process with datasheet ( Gebru et al , 2021 ) . We include studies on the extractiveness of long - form answers ( how much content can be grounded to evidence document ) through a coarse measure of lexical overlap . This is connected to faithfulness and reducing hallucination of QA system . Our study is limited to English sources , and we hope future work can address analysis in other languages . I think one of the biggest ones is that your spouse becomes your legal ' next of kin ' , meaning you can make medical decisions for them , own their property after they die , etc .

If not , the parents could just take the house and all the money ( provided the person did n't have a will Question classification model A difficulty in repurposing NQ is that not all questions with paragraph answers only actually need multiple sentences . To identify complex questions , we built a simple BERT - based classifier , trained to distinguish NQ questions with short answers ( i.e. , less than five tokens ) and ELI5 questions . We use the [ CLS ] token from BERT model to perform prediction . We use the original split from the ELI5 dataset , and split the NQ open 's validation set into val and test set . We preprocessed the questions by converting to lowercase and exclude punctuation to remove syntactic differences between ELI5 and NQ questions . We fine - tuned the bert - base - uncased model for 3 epochs , with an initial learning rate of 5e âˆ’ 5 and batch size of 32 . We use the model with the highest validation F1 as the question classifier , which achieves F1 of 0.97 and 0.94 on validation and test set respectively . We then run this classifier to select the non factoid questions from NQ questions with long - form answers , which classifies around 10 % , out of the 27 , 752 NQ long questions as non - factoid . Examples are in Table 7 .

A.1 Invalid QA We provide definitions , as well as examples of each invalid QA type . No valid answer The answer paragraph does n't provide a valid answer to the question .
