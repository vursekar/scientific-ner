Welcome to the inaugural Workshop on Knowledge Extraction and Integration for Deep Learning Architectures ( DeeLIO ) !
The DeeLIO workshop aims to bring together the knowledge interpretation , extraction and integration lines of research in deep learning , and cover the area in between .
We hope that the DeeLIO workshop will become a regular forum for the exchange of ideas and will contribute to foster collaboration within these research fields .
This volume includes the 11 papers presented at the workshop .
DeeLIO was co - located with the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing ( EMNLP 2020 ) and was held on November 19 , 2020 as an online workshop , following the exceptional " new normal " circumstances of 2020 . 
For the first edition of the workshop , we received 21 paper submissions .
We accepted 11 papers ( acceptance rate 52.4 % ) which were presented at the workshop .
The accepted papers cover both thematic aspects of DeeLIO : the extraction of linguistic knowledge from deep neural models and the integration of knowledge from external resources , for different languages and applications .
In addition to the regular workshop papers , the first edition of DeeLIO also included presentations of several papers from the EMNLP companion volume ' Findings of EMNLP ' which were thematically relevant to the workshop goals .
There was no distinction between oral and poster presentations this year , and all presentations involved pre - recorded talks accompanied with individual live Q&A sessions . 
We take this opportunity to thank the DeeLIO program committee for their thorough reviews .
We also thank the authors who presented their work at DeeLIO , and the workshop participants for the valuable feedback and discussions .
Finally , we are honored to have two excellent invited talks from our invited speakers Ellie Pavlick and Eduard Hovy .
