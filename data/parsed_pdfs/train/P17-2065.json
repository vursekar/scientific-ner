One particularly relevant area is that of compositor attribution-the clustering of pages in a historical printed document by the individual (the compositor) who set the type. Like stylometry, a long-standing area of NLP that has largely focused on attributing the authorship of text (Holmes, 1994;Hope, 1994;Juola, 2006;Koppel et al., 2009;Jockers and Witten, 2010), the analysis of orthographic patterns is fundamental to compositor attribution. Additionally, compositor attribution often makes use of visual features, such as whitespace layout, introducing new challenges. These analyses have traditionally been done by hand, but efforts are painstaking due to the difficulty of manually recording these features.\nIn this paper, we present an unsupervised model specifically designed for compositor attribution that incorporates both textual and visual sources of evidence traditionally used by bibliographers (Hinman, 1963;Taylor, 1981;Blayney, 1991). spelling variation spacing variation medial comma Figure 1: The compositor of the left page tended to use the spellings doe and deere, while the compositor for the right page used spellings do and deare, indicating these pages were likely set by different people. The varying width of the medial comma whitespace also distinguishes the typesetters.\nOur model jointly describes the patterns of variation both in orthography and in the whitespace between glyphs, allowing us to cluster pages by discovering patterns of similarity and difference. When applied to digital scans of historical printed documents, our approach learns orthographic and whitespace preferences of individual compositors and predicts groupings of pages set by the same compositor. 1 This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to perform compositor attribution automatically. Prior work has proposed automatic approaches to authorship attributionwhich is typically viewed as the supervised problem of identifying a particular author given samples of their writing. In contrast, compositor attribution lacks supervision because compositors are unknown and, in addition, focuses on different linguistic patterns. We explain spellings of words conditioned on word choice, not the word choice itself.\nc i s ik m ij d ij dear deere K i J i I Compositor C ! ! ! ! ! !\nEdit operation weights:", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "C w c", "text": "Word variant weights:\nFigure 2: In our model, a compositor ci is generated for page i from a multinomial prior.

Finally, each medial comma spacing width (measured in pixels), s ik , is generated conditioned on ci from a distribution parameterized by \u03b8c.\nTo evaluate our approach, we fit our model to digital scans of Shakespeare's First Folio (1623)a document with well established manual judgements of compositor attribution. We find that even when relying on noisy OCR transcriptions of textual content, our model predicts compositor attributions that agree with manual annotations 87% of the time, outperforming several simpler baselines. Our approach opens new possibilities for considering patterns across a larger vocabulary of words and at a higher visual resolution than has been possible historically. Such a tool may enable scalable first-pass analysis in understudied domains as a complement to humanistic studies of composition.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "In this paper we focus on modeling the same types of observations made by scholars and demonstrate agreement with authoritative attributions. We use compositor studies of Shakespeare's First Folio to inform our approach, drawing on the methods proposed by Hinman (1963), Howard-Hill (1973), andTaylor (1981). Hinman's landmark 1963 study clustered the pages of the First Folio according to five different compositors based on variations in spelling among three common words. Figure 1, for example, shows portions of two pages of the First Folio with different spelling variants for the words dear and do: one compositor used deere and doe, while the other used deare and do. Hinman relied on the assumption that each compositor was consistent in their preferences for the sake of convenience in the typesetting process (Blayney, 1991). Subsequent studies looked at larger sets of words and more general orthographic preferences (e.g. the preference to terminate words with -ie instead of -y), leading to modifications of Hinman's original analysis (Howard-Hill, 1973;Taylor, 1981). In this paper we propose a probabilistic model designed to capture both word-specific preferences and general orthographic patterns. To separate the effect of the compositor from the choices made by the author or editor, we condition on a modernized (collated) version of Shakespeare's text as was done by scholars.\nVisual features, including typeface usage and whitespace layout, also inform compositor attribution. For example, the highlighted spacing in Figure 1 shows different choices after medial commas (commas that occur before the end of the line). Bibliographers produced new hypotheses about how many compositors were involved in production based on the analysis of the use of spaces before and after punctuation (Howard-Hill, 1973;Taylor, 1981). We additionally incorporate this source of evidence into to our automatic approach by modeling pixel-level whitespace distances.\nBibliographers also use contextual information to inform their analyses, including copy text orthography, printing house records, collation, type case usage, and the use of type with cast-on spaces. In our model, we restrict our analysis to only those features that can be derived from the OCR output and simple visual analysis.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Model", "text": "Our computational approach to compositor attribution operates on the sources of evidence that have been considered by bibliographers. In particular, we focus on jointly modeling patterns of orthographic variation and spacing preferences across pages of a document, treating compositor assignments as latent variables in a generative model. We assume access to a diplomatic transcription of the document (a transcription faith-ful to the original orthography), which we automatically align with a modernized version. 2 We experiment with both manually and automatically (OCR) produced transcriptions, and assume access to pixel-level spacing information on each page, which can be extracted using OCR as described in Section 4.\nFigure 2 shows the generative process. In our model, each of I total pages is generated independently. The compositor assignment for the ith page is represented by the variable c i \u2208 {1, . . . , C} and is generated from a multinomial prior. For page i, each diplomatic word, d ij , is generated conditioned on the corresponding modern word, m ij , and the compositor who set the page, c i . Finally, the model produces the pixel width of the space after each medial comma, s ik , again conditioned on the compositor, c i . The joint distribution for page i, conditioned on modern text, takes the following form:\nP ({d ij }, {s ik }, c i |{m ij }) = P (c i )\n[Prior on compositors]\n\u2022 J i j=1 P (d ij |m ij , c i ; w c i ) [Orthographic model] \u2022 K i k=1 P (s ik |c i ; \u03b8 c i ) [Whitespace model]", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Orthographic Preference Model", "text": "We choose the parameterization of the distribution of diplomatic words in order to capture two types of spelling preference: (1) general preferences for certain character groups (such as -ie) and ( 2) preferences that only pertain to a particular word and do not indicate a larger pattern.

Using a log-linear parameterization,\nP (d|m, c; w) \u221d exp(w c f (m, d))\nwe introduce features to capture both effects.\nHere, f (m, d) is a feature function defined on modern word m paired with diplomatic word d, while w c is a weight vector corresponding to compositor c.\nTo capture word-specific preferences we add an indicator feature for each pair of modern word m and diplomatic spelling d. We refer to these as WORD features below. To capture general orthographic preferences we introduce an additional set of features based on the edit operations involved in the computation of Levenshtein distance between m and d. In particular, each operation is added as a separate feature, both with and without local context (previous or next character of the modern word). We refer to this group as EDIT features.

In particular, the choice of spaced or non-spaced punctuation marks is hypothesized by biobliographers to be indicative of compositor preference and specific typecase. We add whitespace distance to our model to capture those observations.

We also evaluate our system against an earlier, highly influential model proposed by Hinman (1963), which we approximate by reverting certain compositor divisions in Blayney's attribution. Hinman's attribution posited five compositors, while Blayney's posited eight. In experiments, we set the model's maximum number of compositors to C = 5 when evaluating on Hinman's attribution, and use C = 8 with Blayney's. We compute the one-to-one and many-to-one accuracy, mapping the recovered page groups to the gold compositors to maximize accuracy, as is standard for many unsupervised clustering tasks, e.g. POS induction (see Christodoulopoulos et al. (2010)).\nBASIC model variant: We evaluate a simple baseline model that uses a multinomial parameterization for generating diplomatic words and does not incorporate spacing information. We use two different options for selection of spelling variants to be considered by the model. First, we consider only the three words selected by Hinman: do, go and here (referred to as HINMAN). Second, we use a larger, automatically selected, word list (referred to as AUTO). Here, we select all modern words with frequency greater than 70 that are not names and that exhibit sufficient variance in diplomatic spellings (most common diplomatic spelling occurs in less than 80% of aligned tokens). For our full model, described in the next section, we always use the larger AUTO word list.\nFEAT model variant: We run experiments with several variants of our full model, described in Section 3 (referred to as FEAT since they use a feature-based parameterization of diplomatic word generation.) We try ablations of WORD and EDIT features, as well as model variants with and without the spacing generation component (referred to as SPACE.)

Our model only detected the presence of five compositors (ranked according to number of pages the compositor set in our model's prediction). Compositor D's habit of omitting u (yong vs. young) and compositor C's usage of spaced medial commas were also noticed in Taylor (1981).\nof the larger word list with feature-based models yields large gains in all scenarios, including evaluation on Hinman's original attributions and while using OCR diplomatic transcriptions. The bestperforming model for both manually transcribed and OCR text uses EDIT features in conjunction with spacing generation and achieves an accuracy of up to 87%. Including WORD features on top of this leads to slightly reduced performance, perhaps as a result of the substantially increased number of free parameters. In the OCR scenario, the addition of WORD features on top of EDIT decreases accuracy, unlike the same experiment with the manual transcription. This is possibly a result of the reduced reliability of full word forms due to mistakes in OCR.\nParticularly interesting is the result that spacing, rarely a factor considered in NLP models, improves the accuracy significantly for our system when compared with EDIT features alone. Because pixel-level visual information and arbitrary orthographic patterns are also the most difficult features to measure manually, our results give strong evidence to the assertion that NLP-style models can aid bibliographers.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results on OCR (character error rate for most plays \u2248 10 \u2212 15%) transcripts are only marginally worse than those on manual transcripts, which shows that our approach can be generalized for the common case where manual diplomatic transcriptions are not available. For our experiments, we also chose a common modern edition of Shakespeare instead of more carefully produced modernized transcription of the facsimile-our goal being to again show that this approach can be generalized, perhaps to documents where careful modernizations of the facsimile are not available. Together, these results suggest that our model may be sufficiently robust to aid bibliographers in their analysis of less studied texts. Figure 3 shows an example of the feature weights and spacing parameters learned by the FEAT w/ ALL model. Our statistical approach is able to successfully explain some of the observations scholars made. For example, Taylor (1981) notices that compositors C and D prefer to omit u in young but A does not. Our model reflects this by giving u \u2192 DEL high weight for D and low weight for A. However, the weight of a single feature is difficult to interpret in isolation. This might be the reason why our model only moderately agrees in case of compositor C. Another example can be seen in spacing patterns: according to Taylor (1981), compositor C uses spaced medial commas unlike A and D. Our model learns the same behavior.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Our primary goal is to scale the methods of compositor attribution, including both textual and visual modes of evidence, for use across books and corpora. By using principled statistical techniques and considering evidence at a larger scale, we offer a more robust approach to compositor identification than has previously been possible. The fact that our system works well on OCR texts means that we are not restricted to only those documents for which we have manually produced transcriptions, opening up the possibility for bibliographic study on a much larger class of texts.\nThough we are unable to incorporate the kinds of world knowledge used by bibliographers, our ability to include more information and more finegrained information allows us to recreate their results. Having validated these techniques on the First Folio, where historical claims are well established, we hope future work can extend these methods and their application.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.
