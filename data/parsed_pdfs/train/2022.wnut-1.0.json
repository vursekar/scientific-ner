Recent years have seen a significant increase of interest in these areas. The internet has democratized content creation leading to an explosion of informal user-generated text, publicly available in electronic format, motivating the need for NLP on noisy text to enable new data analytics applications.\nWe have received 39 main workshop submissions (22 long and 17 short papers). The workshop will be held in hybrid in-person and virtual modes. We have two invited speakers Yulia Tsvetkov (University of Washington) and David Jurgens (University of Michigan) who will talk about their work. We're very thankful to have them in our workshop.\nWe have the best paper award(s) sponsored by Megagon Labs this year, for which we are thankful. We would like to thank the Program Committee members who reviewed the papers. We would also like to thank the workshop participants.
