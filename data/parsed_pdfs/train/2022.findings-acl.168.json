During lessons, teachers can use comprehension questions to increase engagement, test reading skills, and improve retention. Historically such questions were written by skilled teachers, but recently language models have been used to generate comprehension questions. However, many existing Question Generation (QG) systems focus on generating literal questions from the text, and have no way to control the type of the generated question. In this paper, we study QG for reading comprehension where inferential questions are critical and extractive techniques cannot be used. We propose a two-step model (HTA-WTA) that takes advantage of previous datasets, and can generate questions for a specific targeted comprehension skill. We propose a new reading comprehension dataset that contains questions annotated with story-based reading comprehension skills (SBRCS), allowing for a more complete reader assessment. Across several experiments, our results show that HTA-WTA outperforms multiple strong baselines on this new dataset. We show that the HTA-WTA model tests for strong SCRS by asking deep inferential questions.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Reading is an invaluable skill, and is core to communicating in our digital age. Reading also supports other forms of development; when children read, it sharpens their memory, and improves social skills (Halliday, 1973;Mason, 2017). Yet, statistics show that one out of five children in the U.S. face learning difficulties (Shaywitz, 2005), especially in reading (Cornoldi and Oakhill, 2013). The coronavirus pandemic beginning in 2020 had a huge impact on the early reading skills of many children, and threatens to leave a lasting impact on a whole generation of young readers (Gupta and Jawanda, 2020).\nThe pandemic forced many children to learn online, putting in sharp relief the need for effective online education platforms. In particular, reading games have become popular, and can help fill the gap when teachers cannot read in person with students. These platforms present students with short passages and associated comprehension questions. These questions are key to assessing a reader's comprehension of a passage, and can also enhance learning (Chua et al., 2017). But, writing diverse and engaging comprehension questions is a nontrivial task.\nTeachers need to generate new comprehension questions whenever they incorporate new text into a curriculum. New text helps to keep material fresh and topical, and can allow teachers to customize lessons to the interests of a particular student cohort. After finding such custom reading material, teachers must write new comprehension questions to evaluate several reading aspects of comprehension (e.g. understanding complex words, recalling events, etc.).\nThus, to improve the educational process, and lighten the load on teachers, we need tools to automate Question Generation (QG): the task of writing questions for a given passage. Generated questions can be either inferential or literal (extractive) questions. Literal questions can be answered using only information stated in the text, whereas inferential questions require additional information or reasoning. Previous works focused on this aspect of the questions in reading comprehension and discarded the comprehension skills (e.g. close reading, predicting, figurative language, etc.) (Murakhovs' ka et al., 2021).\nWe take inspiration from continual learning (Parisi et al., 2019), which orders a set of learning tasks to improve model performance. We begin by training a model on the general task of QG (How to ask: HTA), and follow with our task of interest: generating a targeted question of a particular type (What to ask: WTA).\nThis paper focuses on the generation of questions for story-based reading comprehension skills (SBRCS), which are varied and cover many aspects of reading comprehension. We create a QG dataset for SBRCS 1 . Although our aim in creating this dataset is to enrich educational applications, this dataset can be considered as a source for general QG and question answering (QA) systems in NLP.\nOur focus here is to build a question generator without answer supervision as the case in a reallife application, where a story only will be given as input. This is a challenging task, as many different questions can be generated from a story when there is no answer supervision. QG with answer supervision is another prevalent research line in the literature (Zhao et al., 2018;Chen and Xu, 2021).\nThe contributions in this work are as follows:\n\u2022 We build a novel QG dataset for SBRCS. The dataset contains advanced reading comprehension skills extracted from stories.\n\u2022 We propose a two-steps method to generate skill-related questions from a given story. The method takes advantage of previous datasets to improve generalizability, and then, teaches a model how to ask predefined styles of questions.\n\u2022 We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method after extensive experiments, and we investigate its performance in a few-shot learning setting.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we present an overview of the literature work. In Section 3, we describe how we built our dataset. Section 4 describes the proposed methodology. The experimental setting is presented in Section 5. The results and the analysis are presented in Section 6.

Many different QG models have been proposed, starting for simple vanilla Sequence to Sequence Neural Networks models (seq2seq) Yuan et al., 2017) to the more recent transformer-based models (Dong et al., 2019;Chan and Fan, 2019;Varanasi et al., 2020;Narayan et al., 2020;Bao et al., 2020). Some QG systems use manual linguistic features in their models (Harrison and Walker, 2018;Khullar et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2019a;Dhole and Manning, 2020), some consider how to select question-worthy content Li et al., 2019;Scialom et al., 2019;, and some systems explicitly model question types (Duan et al., 2017;Sun et al., 2018;Kang et al., 2019;.

To provide good lexical coverage and diverse stories, we choose to write and collect stories that come from a varied set of genres (e.g. science, social studies, fantasy, fairy tale, historical fiction, horror, mystery, adventure, etc.).

Although these questions assess comprehension skills, they do not provide fine-grained evaluation of the reader comprehension. Thus, to build a more comprehensive list of question types, we started by reviewing curriculum documents available from Columbia University Teacher's College Readers 5 and Writers Workshop Program 6 . Then, we compiled a list of SBRCS, which we then expanded to include additional skills based on school teachers' recommendations. In Section A.1, we present further details for each skill type. Also, in Appendix A.2, we give further details on the skills list and on the educational theory behind the skills taxonomy. Our final list contains the following skills:\n1. Basic Story Elements (BSE): Can the reader identify the story's main characters and setting?\nFrom the details in this passage, how many individuals were part of this investigation?\n2. Character Traits (CT): Can the reader identify the traits attributable to certain characters in the story (e.g. character feelings, physical attributes)?\nHow did the Rabbit feel in this passage? Which word in the passage is a synonym for \"stubborn\"?\nWith our list of SBRCS as a guide, we wrote question-answer pairs for each story. Given the difficulty of the task, we needed a large number of    trained content writers to build the required questions. Each written question should fall into one of the mentioned skills. For that, a total of 25 professionals contributed to the writing process (18 teachers, 7 graduate students). Each annotator was asked to write a question per skill for a given story. Not every skill is applicable to every story, so some skills were discarded for some stories. We chose not to use crowdworkers (e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk) to ensure high-quality and educationally-appropriate questions. To verify the quality of the generated content, a second team member reviews each question-answer pair before adding them to the dataset. If the second team member found issues, a discussion took place.\nIn the cases that the team members could not reach an agreement, a third team member is brought in to resolve the disagreement. In addition to annotating questions with a skills label, our content writers annotate each question as either Literal or Inferential question types. This information is important to measure the comprehension performance of the reader on each question type. Overall, we generate 4K question-answer pairs, with an average of 5.5 pairs per story. Note that we did not ask multiple annotators to write questions per story in order to measure the annotators' agreement. Different annotators often write the same question in different ways, or may choose a different question topic for a given skill, or even select a different skill. Thus, measuring inter-annotator agreement is not meaningful. Instead, we chose to ask one annotator to write questions and another to validate the questions grammatically and to check whether the question is correctly related to the chosen skill.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "Given the fact that including more data in a reading comprehension system is important for gen-eralization (Chung et al., 2018;Talmor and Berant, 2019), and given that our created dataset has the SBRCS which are missed in previous datasets, we propose a two-steps method to generate skillrelated questions from a given story: HTA followed by WTA. HTA teaches the model the typical format for comprehension questions using large previously released datasets. We use two well-known datasets, SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and Cos-mosQA (Huang et al., 2019). In Appendix A.3, we add more details on both of these datasets. These previous datasets are not annotated with the question types outlined in Section 3.1, so the HTA phase allows us to take advantage of those datasets. WTA guides the model to generate questions to test the specific comprehension skills enumerated in Section 3.1. Thus, in HTA, we train (fine-tune) a model on large QG datasets, and then, we further train the model to teach the model what to ask (WTA).\nFor the generation model, we use the pre-trained Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), which closely follows the encoder-decoder architecture of the transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017).

However, we cannot incorporate previously released datasets with our new one, as they do not include compatible question skills information. However, they do contain many well-formed and topical questions. Thus, we train a T5 model on SQuAD and CosmosQA datasets to teach the model how to ask questions. Previous neural question generation models take the passage as input, along with the answer. How- ever, encoders can pass all of the information in the input to the decoder, occasionally causing the generated question to contain the target answer. Since the majority of the questions in our created dataset are inferential questions, the answers are not explicitly given in the passages (unlike extractive datasets). Thus, we feed the stories to the encoder, but withhold the answers. Unlike previous systems, we then train the model to generate the questions and answers. We propose this setting to generate fewer literal questions. During our experiments, we evaluated the effect of excluding the answers, and we found them useful to the system.\nIn Figure 1 we show the input-output format of the model.\nThe encoder input is structured as <STORY_TEXT> </s>, where </s> is the end-of-sentence token. The decoder generates multiple questionanswer pairs as <QUESTION_TOKENS>1 <as> <ANSWER_TOKENS>1 <sp> ... <QUESTION_TOKENS>n <as> <ANSWER_TOKENS>n </s>, where <as> separates a question from its answer, and <sp> separates a question-answer pair from another.

The type of generated question is not controlled and is left for the system to decide it. Thus, the generated question is usually an undesired question. Thus, in order to control the style of the generated question, the system needs an indication about the skill that the system is expected to generate a question for.  proposed a way to control the style of the generated questions (e.g. what, how, etc.). The authors built a rulebased information extractor to sample meaningful inputs from a given text, and then learn a joint distribution of <answer, clue, question style> before asking the GPT2 model (Radford et al., 2019) to generate questions. However, this distribution can only be learned using an extractive dataset (e.g. SQuAD); the model cannot learn to generate inferential questions.\nTo control the skill of the generated question, we use a specific prompt per skill, by defining a special token <SKILL_NAME> corresponding to the desired target skill, using the collected dataset. This helps us to control what to extract from the pretrained model. Thus, the encoder takes as input <SKILL_NAME> and <STORY_TEXT>, where <SKILL_NAME> indicates to the model for which skill the question should be generated (see Figure 2). The data format in the decoder is similar to the one in the HTA step, but here the model generates a single question-answer pair. As a result, the encoding of the <STORY_TEXT> will be based on the given <SKILL_NAME>. In this way, the model encodes the same story in a different representation when a different <SKILL_NAME> is given.

On the other hand, Nucleus sampling selects the smallest possible set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability p.

This model takes a passage and an answer as input and generate a question. The answer must be a sub span of the passage.\n\u2022 CGC-QG (Liu et al., 2019a): a Clue Guided Copy network for Question Generation, which is a sequence-to-sequence generative model with a copying mechanism that takes a passage and an answer (as a span in the text) and generate the question. The text representation in the encoder (GRU network) is represented using a variety of features such as GloVe vectors, POS information, answer position, clue word, etc.\n\u2022 AnswerQuest (Roemmele et al., 2021): a pipeline model that uses as a first step a previous model  to retrieve the relevant sentence that has the answer from a document.

The HTA training step is not used here. We use this baseline to evaluate the effect of training WTA using HTA.\nFor all of the previous baselines that require the answer to be a sub-span in the passage, we use the semantic text similarity method that was proposed in (Ghanem et al., 2019) to retrieve the most similar span in the passage. The method extracts several ngrams features from a claim and text spans, and then compute cosine similarity to get the most similar span. In this work, we replace the ngrams features of a text with embeddings extracted from RoBERTa model (Liu et al., 2019b).

We can see that out of the baselines, T5-WTA performs best in terms of BLEURT score (32.96%), followed by NQG-Max with a value of 31.78%. Given its high BLEURT score, it is surprising that T5-WTA model has low BLEU-4. This implies that the generated questions use rich vocabulary, making them different from the gold in terms of overlapping ngrams, but semantically similar leading to higher BLEURT score. As shown in the table, HTA-WTA's BLEURT score outperforms all of the previous QG models by a noticeable margin, showing that including the skill name information plays an important role in generating the intended questions. Also, training on more QG datasets improves the performance. We also noted that the CGC-QG model achieves a higher BLEU-1 than our HTA-WTA model. We argue that this is because the Clue Words Prediction Module learns important cues, increasing the uni-gram overlap with the gold references (BLEU-1).\nRegarding the generated questions type, in Table 3 we show the performance of the T5-based models per question type (inferential and literal). Though One-Step and HTA-WTA models were trained on the same amount of data, the results show that HTA-WTA model clearly performs better than the One-Step model, especially on inferential questions. We see a similar scenario when comparing One-Step and T5-WTA models, yet, the gap is smaller. In general, we can notice that the performance gaps for the inferential questions are larger than the literal ones. Thus, we can conclude that HTA-WTA is generating more correct inferential questions, which is challenging. This experiment concludes that transformers-based models are capable of asking questions beyond the literal meaning of the text. This confirms what was shown by Liu et al. (2021a) regarding the skills that language models can acquire. Additionally, as some training questions directly quote text from the given story. The T5 model was able to learn how to quote the proper segment of the passage when generating questions.\nThe One-Step model performs similarly to the baselines, although it has been trained using the T5 model and on all three datasets. This may be due to the fact that we did not include the skill name in the encoder, which guides the model to generate skill related questions. To better understand the differences between the outputs of One-Step and HTA-WTA models, we used human evaluation. This evaluation is to assess the quality of the generated question in terms of 1. Answerability (Ay), 2. Fluency (Fy), and 3. Grammaticality (Gy) categories, following Harrison and Walker (2018); Azevedo et al. (2020). We include these three criteria as questions may have high Fluency and Grammaticality scores, but not be answerable. We select a sample of 110 story-question pairs from the test dataset, for both models. Then, we perform a human evaluation using crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We use a \"master\" qualification criteria to restrict the participation of workers in our evaluation study to those who have a high historical HIT accuracy, and workers are required to be located in an English speaking country. Each HIT was answered by three workers. Each worker needs reads the story, and provides ratings (1-5, low to high) for the generated questions, and the three criteria. Table 4 shows the average rating assigned by the workers for the 3 criteria. Originally, we hypothesized that adding the skill name to the input would force the model to formulate a specific SBRCS question, even if it is not applicable to the current passage. Omitting the skill name may allow the model score high values as it has been left to decide the question. The results show that both    models are similar in terms of the given categories, except that HTA-WTA performs slightly better in all of the three categories. However, these results refute our claim and show that adding the skill information makes the model generates slightly better questions in terms of quality. In Section A.4, we present an ablation test and discuss some causes of errors in generating questions. Impact of Skill Name Token. In order to quantify the impact of skill name in the input, we do another human manual evaluation to assess how beneficial the skill name token is when we add it to the HTA-WTA model. Thus, we ask two professional persons who were involved in the annotation process to assign skill names to the generated questions of both One-Step and HTA-WTA models. We selected these models as they were trained on the same amount of data; the only difference between them is that the HTA-WTA model uses the skill name token. We utilize the same question sample that was used in the previous human evaluation experiment. Few annotation conflicts were found and were solved after a discussion. We evaluate the results using accuracy (see Table 4). The result for One-Step model is 0.16, and 0.8 for HTA-WTA model. We can clearly see a large gap in accuracy between both models, and this becomes clear with the skills that have a low number of instances in the dataset (e.g. Figurative Language, Predicting, etc.).\nThis result shows that, in addition to using the skill name token to control the skill of the generated questions, it helps the model to learn the underrepresented skills in the dataset. Table 6 in Appendix A.5 presents the F1 scores per skill name. We also notice that HTA-WTA model performed perfectly on the given sample of Predicting and Figurative Language (F1 is 1.0 for each skill). This is an interesting result given that the type of the questions for both skills is inferential, which is harder to generate compared to the literal questions.\nFew-Shot Generation. The process of manually writing questions to assess humans SBRCS is difficult. In some stories, professional writers find obstacles in writing questions for some skills as those skills require high attention and advanced reasoning skills to be written. We can see that in our own dataset, as some skills have fewer questions (e.g. Predicting, Visualizing, etc.). Thus, in this experiment, we evaluate the performance of HTA-WTA model when we inject a low percentage of the skills' instances into the training set. This experiment will simulate the case when training a model on a dataset that contains few skills' instances. We use the stratified sampling technique when sampling fewer instances from the collected dataset. Figure 3 shows that injecting only 10% of the data led to a boost in performance of 5.99 (BLEURT). The result at 10% (33.21%) exceeds the results of most of the baselines and is higher than T5-WTA and NQG-MAX models when trained on all the datasets (see Table 2). In Table A.6 in the appendix, we present the results considering other models and metrics. In most cases, the performance gradually improves as data grows. We notice a small drop when we move from 10% to 30%. This behaviour was previously reported by Stappen et al. (2020). Further research is needed to investigate the causes of this behaviour.

In this work, we chose to use the balanced literacy approach as it benefits from both approaches and as it is the newest approach. At the beginning, we reviewed some of the most commonly used balanced literacy curricula that were released by publishing houses and universities. In particular, we devoted a lot of focus to the Readers and Writers Workshop Model 9 which is developed at Columbia University Teachers College, and to the documentations about reading levels that developed by Scholastic publishing house 10 . The Readers and Writers Workshop curricula were highly instrumental to us in breaking reading comprehension into sub-skills. Also, it is one of the most commonly used and referenced curricula among teachers. We reviewed the workshop materials to create a list of all of the skills that the workshop program highlighted. Then, we matched those against what was offered by Scholastic. This helped us create our primary list of skills. In this study, we are experimenting with nine skills out of around twenty skills. In this phase of the study, we are focusing on the most comprehensive and common skills. In the future, we will expand our work to include the rest of the skills.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "A.3 Additional Data", "text": "In addition to the collected dataset, we use two well-known datasets, SQuAD and CosmosQA. We choose these two datasets because of their large size, and their focus on literal or inferential questions. SQuAD A reading comprehension dataset, consists of questions created by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles that cover a large set of topics (from musical celebrities to abstract concepts), where the answer to every question is a span from the corresponding reading passage (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). This dataset can be considered as an extractive QA dataset. It is one of the largest QA datasets in the literature. In this work, we use SQuAD 2.0 version with discarding the questions that have no answers. The size of the dataset is 100K paragraph/question/answer triplets. CosmosQA It is another reading comprehension dataset consisting of 35.6K paragraph/question pairs that require commonsense-based reading comprehension. It is a collection of people's everyday narratives, and it asks questions about the likely causes of events that require reasoning (Huang et al., 2019). We discard questions that have no answers in this dataset, resulting in 28K paragraph/question/answer triplets.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "A.4 Ablation Test and Error Analysis", "text": "Ablation Test. The results of our experiments confirmed the importance of both the skill name token and the two-steps training method. To quantify the impact of including the skill name token, we run T5-WTA without including the skill name token (T5-WTA-unskilled). We compare the T5-WTAunskilled to the One-Step model; the only difference between these models is that One-Step model includes SQuAD and CosmosQA datasets in the training data. The ablation test results in Table 5 shows that the skill name token and the additional training data both increase model performance. T5-WTA-unskilled BLEURT performance is lower than the BLEURT scores of the other two models.\nError Analysis. Here we are interested in further understanding the HTA-WTA model's performance. We manually examined several generated questions to understand the sources of its errors. Given the unbalanced status of the dataset, we found that the model does not always generate an appropriate question for a given skill name, especially when that skill is underrepresented in the data (e.g. Visualizing, Figurative Language, etc.). In some cases, the model learned the style of the skill's questions, but in the given context, the generated question could not be answered. As an example, the following generated figurative language question quoted a sentence from a story about the space. The sentence is an event in the story and not a figurative language:\nWhich figurative language technique is being used in the phrase \"The first safe trip into space\"?\nThis happens even for very common skill categories, again due to the difficulty (or even impossibility) of generating questions for some skill and story pairs. The other kind of error is the subjectivity in selecting the \"correct\" words from the story. For instance, giving the following Vocabulary question from the dataset: What is the correct definition of the word \"decoy\" as it is used in the story?\nFor this kind of question, annotators chose words that can have multiple meanings, some of which may be unfamiliar to school children. The process of choosing those words is subjective. Although both annotators agreed on the word in the previous example, the model chose to select another word from the story (\"panting\"). In other cases, the question asks about the definition of a word within a sentence from the story (e.g. What is the meaning of \"word\" as it is used in this sentence: \"quoted sentence\"). We noted that when the model generated the question, it selects the correct word but sometimes used a randomly quoted sentence from the story that didn't contain the word.
