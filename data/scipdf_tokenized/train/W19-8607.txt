Computational Argumentation Synthesis as a Language Modeling Task
Synthesis approaches in computational argumentation so far are restricted to generating claim - like argument units or short summaries of debates . Ultimately , however , we expect computers to generate whole new arguments for a given stance towards some topic , backing up claims following argumentative and rhetorical considerations . In this paper , we approach such an argumentation synthesis as a language modeling task . In our language model , argumentative discourse units are the " words " , and arguments represent the " sentences " . Given a pool of units for any unseen topic - stance pair , the model selects a set of unit types according to a basic rhetorical strategy ( logos vs. pathos ) , arranges the structure of the types based on the units ' argumentative roles , and finally " phrases " an argument by instantiating the structure with semantically coherent units from the pool . Our evaluation suggests that the model can , to some extent , mimic the human synthesis of strategy - specific arguments .
Existing research on computational argumentation largely focuses on the analysis side . Various analysis tasks are widely studied including identifying the claims along with their supporting premises ( Stab and Gurevych , 2014 ) , finding the relation between argumentative units ( Cocarascu and Toni , 2017 ) , and assessing the persuasiveness of arguments ( Habernal and Gurevych , 2016 ) . Diverse downstream applications , however , necessitate the development of argumentation synthesis technologies . For example , synthesis is needed to produce a summary of arguments for a given topic ( Wang and Ling , 2016 ) or to build a debating system where new arguments are exchanged between the users and the system ( Le et al , 2018 ) . As a result , a number of recent studies addresses the argumentation synthesis task . These studies have proposed different approaches to generating claims or reasons for a given topic , partly with a particular stance towards the topic ( Bilu and Slonim , 2016 ; Hua and Wang , 2018 ) . However , the next important synthesis step is still missing in the literature , namely , to generate complete texts including both argumentative and rhetorical considerations . With the latter , we refer to Aristotle 's three means of persuasion : logos ( providing logical arguments ) , ethos ( demonstrating credibility ) , and pathos ( evoking emotions ) . As discussed by Wachsmuth et al ( 2018 ) , following a rhetorical strategy is key to achieving persuasion with argumentative texts . This paper proposes a new computational approach that synthesizes argumentative texts following a rhetorical strategy . We do not tackle this task immediately " in the wild " , i.e. , generating an entirely new argumentative text for a freely - chosen topic and a possibly complex strategy . Rather , we consider a " controlled " synthesis setting , with the goal of successively creating models that are able to deal with more complex settings later on . In particular , given a pool of argumentative discourse units ( ADUs ) , our approach generates arguments for any unseen pair of topic and stance ( e.g. , " con abortion " ) as well as a basic rhetorical strategy ( i.e. , logos - oriented vs. pathos - oriented ) . 1 To abstract from the arguments ' topics during training , we first identify different ADU types using clustering . Our approach then learns to select unit types matching the given strategy and to arrange them according to their argumentative roles . Both steps are realized as a language model where ADUs represent words and arguments are sentences . Finally , our approach " phrases " an argument by predicting the best set of semantically related ADUs for the arranged structure using supervised regression . Thereby , we ensure that the synthesized texts are composed of meaningful units , a property that neural generation methods barely achieve so far . In our evaluation , we utilize the dataset of Wachsmuth et al ( 2018 ) . This dataset contains 260 argumentative texts on 10 topic - stance pairs , where each text composes five ADUs in a logos - oriented or pathos - oriented manner . In our experiments , we train our approach on nine topic - stance pairs and then generate an argument for the tenth . The results demonstrate that our approach successfully manages to combine pairs of ADUs , but its performance on longer sequences of ADUs is limited . Altogether , our contribution is three - fold : 1 . A new view of argumentation synthesis that represents argumentative and rhetorical considerations with language modeling . 2 . A novel approach that selects , arranges , and phrases ADUs to synthesize strategy - specific arguments for any topic and stance . 3 . First experimental evidence that arguments with basic rhetorical strategies can be synthesized computationally . 2
Recently , some researchers have tackled argumentation synthesis statistically with neural networks . For instance , Wang and Ling ( 2016 ) employed a sequence - to - sequence model to generate summaries of argumentative texts , and Hua and Wang ( 2018 ) did similar to generate counterarguments . Using neural methods in text generation , it is possible to achieve output that is on topic and grammatically ( more or less ) correct . However , when the desired text is to span multiple sentences , the generated text regularly suffers from incoherence and repetitiveness , as for instance discussed by Holtzman et al ( 2018 ) who examine texts that were produced by RNNs in various domains . While these problems may be tolerable to some extent in some applications , such as chatbots , bad text can not be accepted in an argumentative or debating scenario , where the goal is to convince or persuade a reader ( rather than to merely inform or entertain ) . Holtzman et al ( 2018 ) propose to alleviate incoherence and repetitiveness by training a set of discriminators , which aim to ensure that a text respects the Gricean maxims of quantity , quality , relation , and manner ( Grice , 1975 ) . To this end , they employ specific datasets , such as one that opposes authentic text continuation to randomly - sampled text . The discriminators learn optimal weightings for the various models and their combination , such that overall text quality is maximized . For argumentation , we hypothesize that one needs to go even further and eventually account for the author , implementing her underlying intention in the different parts of an argumentative text as well as in the relations between the parts . In the past times of rule - based text generation , argumentation synthesis was a popular task ( Zukerman et al , 2000 ) . Approaches involved much handcrafted ( linguistic and domain ) knowledge and user modeling . For example , the system of Carenini and Moore ( 2006 ) compares attributes of houses ( from a database ) to desired target attributes ( from a user model ) , to then recommend a house to the reader in a convincing text following the Gricean maxims . To this end , it selected house attributes potentially interesting to the user , arranged , and finally phrased them . The resulting texts resembled the arguments we work with here , which have been manually composed by experts ( Wachsmuth et al , 2018 ) from the claims , evidence , and objections in the arg - microtext corpus ( Peldszus and Stede , 2016 ) . To achieve a similar level of output control , today 's text - to - text generation models need to account for the various interdependencies between the text units to be combined . Most related to our approach is the system of , where a user can enter a claimlike topic along with a stance . The system then generates argumentative paragraphs on specific aspects of the topic by selecting sentences from 10 million news texts of the Gigaword corpus . Potentially relevant aspects are those that trigger evaluative judgment in the reader . The sentences are arranged so that the text starts with a claim sentence and is followed by support sentences , employing the approach of . The support sentences are ordered by maximizing the semantic connectivity between sentences . Finally , some rephrasing is done in terms of certain aspects of surface realization . In a manual evaluation , however , no text was seen as sounding natural , underlining the difficulty of the task . In contrast to , we learn directly from input data what argumentative discourse units to combine and how to arrange them . We leave surface realization aside to keep the focus on the argument composition .

Stance Con Table 1 : The candidate thesis , con , and pro units for one topic - stance pair in the dataset of Wachsmuth et al ( 2018 ) . Some other approaches have been proposed that recompose existing text segments in new arguments . In particular , Bilu and Slonim ( 2016 ) generated new claims by " recycling " topics and predicates that were found in a database of claims . Claim selection involves preferring predicates that are generally amenable to claim units and that are relevant for the target topic . Egan et al ( 2016 ) created summaries of the main points in a debate , and synthesized complete arguments from a set of manually curated topic - stance relations based on the fine - grained argument model of Toulmin ( 1958 ) . However , we are not aware of any approach that synthesizes arguments fully automatically , let al ne that follows rhetorical considerations in the synthesis process .
To develop our model for argumentation synthesis , we exploit the dataset recently developed by Wachsmuth et al ( 2018 ) . The dataset comprises 260 manually generated argumentative texts . The generation of each text , for one topic - stance pair , has been conducted in a systematic fashion following the three canons of rhetoric ( Aristotle , 2007 ) : 1 . Inventio ∼ Selecting a subset of argumentative discourse units ( ADUs ) from a pool of given ADUs for a topic - stance pair . 2 . Dispositio ∼ Arranging the selected ADUs in a sequential order . 3 . Elocutio ∼ Phrasing the arranged ADUs by adding connectives at unit - initial or unit - final positions . Specifically , Wachsmuth et al ( 2018 ) selected a pool of 200 ADUs for 10 pairs of controversial topic and stance from the English version of the arg - microtexts corpus ( Peldszus and Stede , 2016 ) . As a preprocessing step , they " decontextualized " these ADUs manually by removing connectives , resolving pronouns , and similar . Each topic - stance pair comes with 20 such ADUs : four theses , four con units , and 12 pro units . Table 1 shows the ADU list for one topic - stance pair . 26 participants were asked by Wachsmuth et al ( 2018 ) to create short argumentative texts for each topic - stance pair following one of two basic rhetorical strategies : ( 1 ) logos - oriented , i.e. , arguing logically , and ( 2 ) pathos - oriented , i.e. , arguing based on emotional appeals . For each topic - stance pair they created an argument by selecting one thesis , one con and three pro units that they thought could best form a persuasive argument following the given strategies . Table 2 shows two samples of generated arguments in the dataset . The dataset contains 130 logos - oriented and 130

We use these 260 texts to develop and evaluate our computational model for argumentation synthesis .
This section presents our computational approach to synthesize arguments for any pair of topic and stance , following one of two basic rhetorical strategies : arguing logically ( logos - oriented ) or arguing emotionally ( pathos - oriented ) . A black - box view of the approach is shown in Figure 1 . As input , our approach takes a strategy as well as a pool of argumentative discourse units ( ADUs ) for any specific topic - stance pair x. Each ADU has the role of a thesis ( in terms of claim with a stance on the topic ) , a con point ( objecting the thesis ) , or a pro point ( supporting the thesis ) . The approach then imitates the human selection , arrangement , and " phrasing " of a sequence of n ADUs , in order to synthesize an argument . Phrasing is done only in terms of picking semantically coherent ADUs for the arranged sequence ; the addition of connectives between ADUs is left to future work . Below , we detail how we realize each step ( selection , arrangement , and phrasing ) with a topicindependent model . For each step , we explain how it is trained ( illustrated in Figure 2 ) and how it is applied to an unseen topic - stance pair ( Figure 3 ) .
This model handles the selection of a set of n ADUs for a topic - stance pair x and a rhetorical strategy . We approach the selection as a language modeling task where each ADU is a " word " of our language model and each argument a " sentence " . To abstract from topic , the model actually selects ADU types , as explained in the following .
Output Strategy - specific arg '
Figure 1 : Black - box view of our argumentation synthesis approach . The input is a rhetorical strategy as well as a pool of thesis , con , and pro ADUs for some topicstance pair x. The approach outputs a strategy - specific sequence of n ADUs as an argument for x ( here , n = 5 ) .
We start from a training set of ADUs for a set of m topic - stance pairs . To generalize the language model beyond the covered topics , each ADU is represented using features that aim to capture general emotion - related and logic - related characteristics , accounting for the two given strategies . In particular , we first cluster the pool of all training ADUs based on their feature representation . As a result , each ADU is represented by a cluster label ( A - F in Figure 2 ) , where each label represents one ADU type . Now , for each of the strategies , we map each manually - generated sequence of ADUs to a sequence of cluster labels . Using these sequences of labels , we train one separated selection language model for each strategy . For clustering , we rely on topic - independent features that we expect to implicitly encode logical and emotional strategies : ( 1 ) psychological meaningfulness ( Pennebaker et al , 2015 ) , ( 2 ) eight basic emotions ( Plutchik , 1980 ; Mohammad and Turney , 2013 ) , and ( 3 ) argumentativeness ( Somasundaran et al , 2007 ) . In the following , we elaborate on the concrete features that we extract : The input is a corpus of argumentative texts for m topic - stance pairs , each decomposed into a sequence of theses , con units , and pro units . Initially , the set of all these ADUs is clustered to obtain a set topic - independent ADU types , called A - F here . ( 1 ) Selection language model : Each argument is converted from a sequence of ADUs to a sequence of ADU types , where a language model is trained on these type sequences . ( 2 ) Arrangement language model : Each argument is converted from a sequence of ADUs to a sequence of ADU roles ( thesis , pro , and con ) where a language model is trained on these ADU role sequences . ( 3 ) Phrasing regression model : A linear regression model is trained which scores each ADU sequence with respect to its semantic coherence .
LIWC is a lexicon - based text analysis that counts words in psychologically meaningful categories ( Tausczik and Pennebaker , 2010 ) . We use the version by Pennebaker et al ( 2015 ) , which contains the following 15 dimensions : 1 . Language metrics , e.g. , words per sentence . 2 . Function words , e.g. , pronouns and auxiliary verbs . 3 . Other grammar , e.g. , common verbs and comparisons . 4 . Affect words , e.g. , positive emotion words . 5 . Social words , e.g. , " family " and " friends " . 6 . Cognitive processes , e.g. , " discrepancies " and " certainty " . 7 . Perceptual processes , e.g. , " feeling " . 8 . Biological processes , e.g. , " health " . 9 . Core drives and needs , e.g. , " power " and " reward focused " . 10 . Time orientation , e.g. , past - focused . 11 . Relativity , e.g. , " time " and " space " . 12 . Personal concerns , e.g. , " work " and " leisure " . 13 . Informal speech , e.g. , fillers and nonfluencies . 14 . Punctuation , e.g. , periods and commas . 15 . Summary variables , as detailed below . There are four summary variables , each of which is derived from various LIWC dimensions : ( 1 ) analytical thinking ( Pennebaker et al , 2014 ) , i.e. , the degree to which people use narrative language ( low value ) , or more logical and formal language ( high ) ; ( 2 ) clout ( Kacewicz et al , 2014 ) , i.e. , the relative social status , confidence , and leadership displayed in a text ; ( 3 ) authenticity ( Newman et al , 2003 ) , i.e. , the degree to which people reveal themselves in an authentic way ; and ( 4 ) emotional tone ( Cohn et al , 2004 ) , i.e. , negative for values lower than 50 and positive otherwise .
We use the NRC lexicon of Mohammad and Turney ( 2013 ) . The lexicon has been compiled manually using crowdsourcing and contains a set of English words and their associations with ( 1 ) sentiment , i.e. , negative and positive polarities , and ( 2 ) emotions , i.e. , the eight basic emotions defined by Plutchik ( 1980 ) : anger , anticipation , disgust , fear , joy , surprise , sadness , and trust . These features are represented as the count of words associated with each category ( e.g. , the count of sad words in an ADU ) . Somasundaran et al ( 2007 ) constructed a lexicon that includes the following arguing patterns : assessments , doubt , authority , emphasis , necessity , causation , generalization , structure , conditionals , inconsistency , possibility , wants , contrast , priority , difficulty , inyour - From the type sequence , a set of candidate arguments is decoded . ( 2 ) The arrangement filters out candidates not matching the most probable ADU role sequence , ( T hesis , Con , P ro , P ro , P ro ) . ( 3 ) Phrasing scores each remaining argument and outputs the top argument .
shoes , rhetorical question . We use the count of each arguing pattern in text as one feature ( e.g. , number of assessments patterns in an ADU ) .
As shown in Figure 3 , the selection language model takes the ADUs of an unseen topic - stance x as input . It then outputs a set of candidate arguments , in terms of sequences of ADUs . Each ADU is encoded into a cluster label ( representing an ADU type ) . For example , one might have the following mappings , given the six labels A - F from Figure 2 : A { T he x , 1 , T he x , 2 , Con x , 3 } B { Con x , 2 , P ro x , 1 } C { T he x , 3 , Con x , c , P ro x , 2 , P ro x , 3 } D { P ro x , p , Con x , 1 } E { T he x , t } F { T he x , 4 , Con x , 4 , P ro x , 4 } The language model for either of the two rhetorical strategies generates a set of arguments where each argument is composed of n cluster labels , e.g. , ( A , B , C , D , C ) for n = 5 in Figure 3 . This set is ranked by probability of the associated sequence . For example , assume that ( A , B , C , D , C ) is most probable . Then we decode all possible ADU sequences for topic - stance x from ( A , B , C , D , C ) to a set of candidate arguments : ( A , B , C , D , C ) { T he x , 1 , T he x , 2 , Con x , 3 } × { Con x , 2 , P ro x , 1 } × { T he x , 3 , Con x , c , P ro x , 2 , P ro x , 3 } × { P ro x , p , Con x , 1 } × { T he x , 3 , Con x , c , P ro x , 2 , P ro x , 3 } The output of the model is a set of candidate arguments , which becomes the input of the arrangement language model .
In the arrangement process , we aim to imitate the human behavior of arranging ADUs for a specific topic - stance following a rhetorical strategy ( here , logos or pathos ) . Again , we approach this problem as a language modeling task . Each ADU role ( thesis , pro , or con ) is a word of the language model and each argument a sentence .
As sketched in Figure 2 , we first convert the humangenerated arguments from a sequence of ADUs to a sequence of ADU roles . Then , we use these sequences to train a language model for each strategy .
As shown in Figure 3 , the arrangement language model takes as input the candidate arguments that we get from the selection language model and outputs a set of filtered candidate arguments . The language model for a specific strategy generates a set of argument structures where each such structure is a sequence of n ADU roles , e.g. , ( T hesis , Con , P ro , P ro , P ro ) for n = 5 in Figure 3 . This set is ranked by the probability of the sequences . For example , assume that the most frequent sequence is ( T hesis , Con , P ro , P ro , P ro ) . Using the output from the selection language model , we filter out all candidate arguments that do not match ( T hesis , Con , P ro , P ro , P ro ) , ending up with the following filtered arguments : { T he x , 1 , T he x , 2 } × { Con x , 2 } × { P ro x , 2 , P ro x , 3 } × { P ro x , p } × { P ro x , 2 , P ro x , 3 } The output of the model is a filtered set of candidate arguments , which becomes the input of the phrasing regression model .
The set of arguments resulting from the selection and arrangement language models are based on topic - independent features . The missing step is to entail the topical relationship between the ADUs in each generated argument . We approach this task with supervised regression . As indicated above , our model does not really phrase an argument . Rather , it aims to choose the best among the given set of candidates in terms of semantic coherence .
For each argument , we opt for a feature representation that embeds the content properties of ADUs in order to capture their content relationship . Concretely , we represent each argument by calculating the semantic similarities of each adjacent bigram in a human - generated argument . We train a linear regression model where each instance represents the features of one argument . To this end , we set a score to be the sum of the probabilities of ADU bigrams occurring in one argument . The phrasing model scores each of the filtered arguments given as output by the arrangement model . The argument with the highest score is the final generated argument .
At this point , the phrasing model is provided by the filtered arguments from the arrangement model . For each filtered argument , we extract the bigram features ( semantic similarities ) . Next , using the phrasing model , we predict the score of each sequence . The sequence with the highest score is the generated argument . In Figure 3 , this is : ( T he x , 2 , Con x , 2 , P ro x , 2 , P ro x , p , P ro x , 3 )
In this section , we report the results of evaluating the introduced approach to argumentation synthesis based on the dataset described in Section 3 .
Our experiments are designed in leave - one - topicout cross - validation setting : From the 10 topicstance pairs in the dataset , we use nine for training and the last as the test fold , and we repeat this once for each possible fold . This way , no topic - specific knowledge can be used in the synthesis process . For each given basic rhetorical strategy ( logosoriented and pathos - oriented ) , we train one model each for the selection , the arrangement , and the " phrasing " of argumentative discourse units ( ADUs ) on the nine training folds . The arguments synthesized by their combination are then evaluated against the human - generated arguments in the test folds . The evaluation covers all three models as well as the final generated argument for each strategy . We report the average accuracy across all ten folds for each of the models .
In each training / test experiment for one of the two strategies , we first abstract all ADUs across all strategy - specific topic - stance pairs by extracting the LIWC , NRC , and MPQA features , as described in Section 4.1 . Then , we cluster the given training set using standard k - means ( Ostrovsky et al , 2012 ) . After some initial experiments , we decide to set k to 6 , because this best balanced the distribution of arguments over clusters , and showed clear strategyspecific differences . 3 Using the resulting clustering model , we predicted the type A - F of each ADU in the test set ( the tenth topic ) . Given the ADU types , we next converted the human - generated training and test arguments from a sequence of ADUs to a sequence of ADU types . After that , we trained one 2 - gram and one 3 - gram selection language . 4 In Table 3 , we report the mean perplexity of the models for both strategies . As shown , the 2 - gram perplexity is lower than the 3 - gram perplexity in both cases . We assume that the reason lies in the limited size of the dataset and the narrow setting : Only 117 sentences ( ADUs ) are given per strategy for training , with a vocabulary size of 6 ( number of ADU types ) . Based on the results , we decided to use the 2 - gram selection language model to generate candidate arguments .
To train arrangement as described in Section 4.2 , we took all arguments of the nine training topics in each experiment . We converted each argument from a sequence of ADUs to a sequence of ADU roles ( thesis , pro , and con ) . After that , we trained a 2 - gram and 3 - gram language model for each strategy . Table 4 lists the mean perplexity values over the 10 folds . Here , the perplexity is lower for 3 - grams than for 2 - grams , which can be expected to yield better performance . Therefore , we used the 3 - gram language model to filter the set of candidate arguments .
For phrasing ( in terms of choosing the best ADU sequence ) , we first extracted features from each candidate , as described in Section 4.3 . Then , we calculated the semantic similarities between each pair of adjacent ADUs as follows : 1 . We obtained a 300 - dimensional word embedding for each word in an ADU using the pre - trained GloVe common - crawl model ( Pennington et al , 2014 ) . 5 2 . We averaged the embeddings of all words in an ADU , resulted in one vector representing the ADU . 3 . For each adjacent pair of ADUs , we computed the cosine similarity of their vectors . Figure 4 shows a histogram of the distribution of the cosine similarities of each adjacent pair of 5 The used model can be found here : http://nlp . stanford.edu/data/glove.42B.300d.zip . ADUs ( i.e. , each ADU 2 - gram ) in logos - oriented arguments and in pathos - oriented arguments . We observe a generally high similarity between neighboring ADUs for both strategies , with logos - oriented 2 - grams being slightly more similar on average . Given the ADU 2 - grams , we train a linear regression model that predicts the sum of ADU 2 - gram probabilities in each argument . In case of the logos strategy , the model has a mean squared error ( MSE ) of 0.05 . In case of pathos the MSE is 0.03 .
Up to this point , we trained all selection , arrangement , and phrasing models 10 times . Combining the three models for each strategy , we finally generated one argument per strategy for the topic - stance pair left out in each experiments . Hence , we ended up with 10 computationally synthesized arguments per strategy in total . We evaluate each of these arguments by checking whether it matches any of the 13 humangenerated ground - truth arguments given per topicstance pair . The matching is quantified in terms of n - gram overlap with n = { 1 , . . . , 5 } . For comparison , we consider a baseline that randomly generates arguments for each topic - stance pair as follows : 1 . Select a random thesis unit from t 1 to t 4 . 2 . Select a random con unit from c 1 to c 4 . 3 . Select three random pro units from p 1 to p 12 . 4 . Randomly arrange the selected units . Table 5 : Accuracy of n - gram overlaps between the human - generated arguments for each strategy and the arguments computationally synthesized by our model and the baseline . In the sequential case , the ordering is considered , in the non - sequential case , it is ignored . The better result in each experiment is marked bold , if any .

universities should not charge tuition fees in Germany . c3 to oblige non - academics to finance others ' degrees through taxes is not just . p9 this would impede or prevent access to those who are financially weaker . p5 if a university lacks the funds , sponsors must be found . p8 there are other instruments to motivate tighter discipline while studying .
p2 education must not be a question of money in a wealthy society such as Germany . c1 one could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped . p7 studying and taking higher degrees must remain a basic right for everyone . p6 longer durations of studies are costly . t2 the universities in Germany should not under any circumstances charge tuition fees . Table 6 : Comparison of two con arguments computationally synthesized with our model for the topic Should all universities in Germany charge tuition fees ? , each being a sequence of five ADUs . A logos - oriented argument ( t 4 , c 3 , p 9 , p 5 , p 8 ) and a pathos - oriented argument ( p 2 , c 1 , p 7 , p 6 , t 2 ) . The thesis of each argument is marked bold . and by the baseline , with and without considering the ordering of ADUs . Our models outperform the baseline for 1 - grams and 2 - grams in all cases . For sequential 3 - grams , however , it did not achieve any overlap with the human - generated arguments for either strategy . This may be explained by the fact that the employed selection and phrasing models are based on 2 - grams only . For n ≥ 2 , the synthesis generally does not work well anymore . We believe that the small data size is a main cause behind this , although it may also point to the limitation of composing ADUs based on surface features . In the non - sequential case , though , our model performs comparably well for 3 - grams , and it even manages to correctly synthesize some ADU 4 - grams . In Table 6 , we exemplify the top - scored arguments for one topic - stance pair , synthesized by our approach for logos and for pathos respectively . They indicate that our model was able to learn strategy - specific differences . 6 In particular , the logos argument starts with the thesis ( t 2 ) , as argumentation guidelines suggest . It then reasons based on consequences and alternatives . Matching intu - ition , the pathos argument appeals more to emotion , reflected in phrases such as " wealthy society " and " under any circumstances " . Particularly the thesis ( t 4 ) has a more intense tonality than t 2 , and putting it at the end creates additional emphasis .
This paper has presented a topic - independent computational approach to imitate the process of selecting , arranging , and phrasing argumentative discourse units ( ADUs ) - so to speak , to synthesize arguments . We have proposed to operationalize the necessary synthesis knowledge in the form of a combined language and regression model that predicts ADU sequences . So far , we have evaluated our approach on a small dataset only that contains 260 argumentative texts following either of two rhetorical strategies . For a controlled experiment setting based on this data , we have reported preliminary results of medium effectiveness regarding the imitation of human - generated arguments . A big challenge for the future is to move from such a controlled setting to a real - world scenario , where arguments have to be formed for a freelychosen topic from material that is mined from the web . Still , our topic - independent approach defines a first substantial step in this direction .
