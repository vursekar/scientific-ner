Using data from a large-scale medical licensing exam, clustering methods identified items that were similar with respect to their relative difficulty and relative response-time intensiveness to create low response process complexity and high response process complexity item classes. Interpretable models were used to investigate the linguistic features that best differentiated between these classes from a descriptive and predictive framework. Results suggest that nuanced features such as the number of ambiguous medical terms help explain response process complexity beyond superficial item characteristics such as word count. Yet, although linguistic features carry signal relevant to response process complexity, the classification of individual items remains challenging.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The success of high-stakes exams, such as those used in licensing, certification, and college admission, depends on the use of items (test questions) that meet stringent quality criteria. To provide useful information about examinee ability, good items must be neither too difficult, nor too easy for the intended test-takers. Furthermore, the timing demands of items should be such that different exam forms seen by different test-takers should entail similar times to complete. Nevertheless, while an extreme difficulty or mean response time can indicate that an item is not functioning correctly, within these extremes variability in difficulty and item response time is expected. For good items, it is hoped that this variability simply reflects the breadth and depth of the relevant exam content.\nThe interaction between item difficulty (as measured by the proportion of examinees who respond correctly) and time intensiveness (as measured by the average time examinees spend answering) can help quantify the complexity of the response process associated with an item. This is valuable, since the more we know about the way examinees think about the problem presented in an item, the better we can evaluate exam validity. Although easier items usually require less time than difficult items, the interaction between these two item properties is not strictly linear -examinees may spend very little time responding to certain difficult items and, likewise, examinees may spend a great deal of time on items that are relatively easy. The idea of response process complexity is best illustrated with items that have similar difficulty but different mean response times. In such cases, one item may require the formation of a complex cognitive model of the problem and thus take a long time, while another item with a similar level of difficulty may require factual knowledge that few examinees recall (or that many recall incorrectly) and thus take a short time on average. The interaction between item difficulty and time intensity can therefore provide valuable information about the complexity of the response process demanded by an item, which, we argue, can be further explained by examining the linguistic properties of the item.\nIn this paper, we use a data-driven approach to capture the interaction between item difficulty and response time within a pool of 18,961 multiplechoice items from a high-stakes medical exam, where each item was answered by 335 examinees on average. For our data, this resulted in the definition of two clusters, one of which consisted of items that are relatively easy and less time-intensive, and another one which consisted of items that are relatively difficult and/or time-intensive. For the purposes of this study, we name these two clusters low-complexity class and high-complexity class, respectively. The use of the term response process A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, chills, and fatigue. He has not had any sick contacts. He underwent splenectomy for traumatic injury at the age of 13 years. He has no other history of serious illness and takes no medications. He appears ill. His temperature is 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. On pulmonary examination, scattered crackles are heard bilaterally. Abdominal shows a well-healed midline scar and mild, diffuse tenderness to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Antibiotic therapy (B) Antiemetic therapy (C) CT scan of the chest (D) X-ray of the abdomen (E) Reassurance Table 1: An example of a practice item complexity here is not based on an operational definition of this construct, which would require extensive research on its own, but rather, as a succinct label that summarises the differences between the two classes along the interaction of empirical item difficulty and item time intensiveness.\nStudying the linguistic characteristics of these two categories may help test developers gain a more nuanced understanding of how cognitively complex items differ from those with a straightforward solution. Provided that strong relationships are found, such insight can also be used to guide item writers or inform innovative automated item generation algorithms when seeking to create high-or low-complexity items. For this reason, our goal is not to train a black-box model to predict item complexity; instead, our goal is to isolate interpretable relationships between item text and item complexity that can inform our understanding of the response process and provide better itemwriting strategies.\nIn addition to its utility for improving highstakes exams, the problem of modeling response process complexity is interesting from an NLP perspective because it requires the modeling of cognitive processes beyond reading comprehension. This is especially relevant for the data used here because, as we explain in Section 3 below, the items in our bank assess expert-level clinical knowledge and are written to a common reading level using standardized language.\nContributions: i) We use unsupervised clustering to define classes of high and low responseprocess complexity from a large sample of items and test-takers in a high-stakes medical exam; ii) the study provides empirical evidence that linguistic characteristics carry signal relevant to an item's response process complexity; iii) the most predictive features are identified through several feature selection methods and their potential relationship to response process complexity is discussed; iv) the errors made by the model and their implications for predicting response process complexity are analysed.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "This section discusses related work on the topics of modeling item difficulty and response time.\nMost NLP studies modeling the difficulty of test questions for humans have been conducted in the domain of reading comprehension, where the readability of reading passages is associated with the difficulty of their corresponding comprehension questions (Huang et al., 2017;Beinborn et al., 2015;Loukina et al., 2016). For other exams, taxonomies representing knowledge dimensions and cognitive processes involved in the completion of a test task have been used to predict the difficulty of short-answer questions (Pad\u00f3, 2017) and identify skills required to answer school science questions (Nadeem and Ostendorf, 2017). Difficulty prediction has also been explored in the context of evaluating automatically generated questions (Alsubait et al., 2013;Ha and Yaneva, 2018;Kurdi, 2020; through measures such as question-answer similarity.\nResponse time prediction has mainly been explored in the field of educational testing using predictors such as item presentation position (Parshall et al., 1994), item content category (Parshall et al., 1994;Smith, 2000), the presence of a figure (Smith, 2000;Swanson et al., 2001), and item difficulty and discrimination (Halkitis et al., 1996;Smith, 2000). The only text-related feature explored in these studies was word count, and it was shown to have a very limited predictive power in most domains.\nSeveral studies have explored the prediction of item difficulty and response time in the context of clinical multiple choice questions (MCQs). Ha et al. (2019) propose a large number of linguis-tic features and embeddings for modeling item difficulty. The results show that the full model outperforms several baselines with a statistically significant improvement, however, its practical significance for successfully predicting item difficulty remains limited, confirming the challenging nature of the problem. Continuations of this study include the use of transfer learning to predict difficulty and response time (Xue et al., 2020), as well as using predicted difficulty for filtering out items that are too easy or too difficult for the intended examinee population .  used a broad range of linguistic features and embeddings (similar to those in Ha et al. (2019)) to predict item response time, showing that a wide range of linguistic predictors at various levels of linguistic processing were all relevant to responsetime prediction. The predicted response times were then used in a subsequent experiment to improve fairness by reducing the time intensity variance of exam forms.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "The data 1 used in this study comprises 18,961\nStep 2 Clinical Knowledge items from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE \u00ae ), a large-scale high-stakes medical assessment. All items were MCQs. An example practice item 2 is given in Table 1. The exam comprises several one-hour testing blocks with 40 items per block. All items test medical knowledge and are written by experienced item-writers following guidelines intended to produce items that vary in their difficulty and response times only due to differences in the medical content they assess. These guidelines stipulate that item writers adhere to a standard structure and avoid excessive verbosity, extraneous material not needed to answer the item, information designed to mislead the test-taker, and grammatical cues (e.g., correct answers that are more specific than the other options). All items were administered between 2010 and 2015 as pretest items and presented alongside scored items on operational exams. Examinees were medical students from accredited US and Canadian medical schools taking the exam for the first time and had no way of knowing which items were pretest items and which were 1 The data cannot be made available due to exam security considerations.\n2 Source: https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/ step-2-ck/2020_Step2CK_SampleItems.pdf scored.

Item difficulty is measured by the proportion of examinees who answered the item correctly, a metric commonly referred to by the educational testing community as p-value and calculated as follows:\nP i = N n=1 U n N ,\nwhere P i is the p-value for item i, U n is the 0-1 score (incorrect-correct) on item i earned by examinee n, and N is the total number of examinees in the sample. Thus, difficulty measured in this way ranges from 0 to 1 and higher values correspond to easier items.\nTime intensity is found by taking the arithmetic mean response time, measured in seconds, across all examinees who attempted a given item. This includes all time spent on the item from the moment it is presented on the screen until the examinee moves to the next item, as well as any revisits.\nTo assign items to classes, p-value and mean response time are rescaled such that each variable has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Moreover, we use two quantitative methods to categorize items and retain only those items where there was agreement between the two methods.\nMethod 1: Items were classified by applying a K-means clustering algorithm via the kmeans function in Python's Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). K-means is an unsupervised data classification technique that discovers patterns in the data by assigning instances to a pre-defined number of classes (Wagstaff et al., 2001). This approach also allows us to evaluate the plausibility of categorizing items into more than two complexity classes, or whether the items fail to show any meaningful separation along the interaction of p-value and duration (one class). Results suggest that two classes best fit these data and identified 11,067 items as low complexity and 7,894 items as high complexity 3 .\nMethod 2: Any item with a rescaled p-value greater than its rescaled mean response time -indicating that the item is relatively easier than it is time-consuming -is classified as low-complexity (11,682 items). Likewise, the remaining items, which had rescaled p-values less than their rescaled mean response times, were assigned to the highcomplexity class (7,279 items). Put another way, if an item takes less time than we would expect given its difficulty, the item is classified as low response process complexity and if it takes more time than we would expect, it is classified as high response process complexity.\nThe two methods achieved strong agreement, with only 673 (3.5%) items being assigned to different classes across methods. These discrepant items are excluded, leaving a total of 18,288 items for further analysis: 11,038 low-complexity items and 7,250 high-complexity ones. Figure 1 shows the class assignment, p-value, and mean response time for each item. As can be seen from the figure, the class of lowcomplexity items was dense and homogenous compared to the high-complexity class, meaning that it contained a large number of easy items whose response times were always below 125 seconds. The high-complexity class on the other hand was highly heterogeneous, with items whose response times and p-values spanned almost the entire scale.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Features", "text": "We use a set of interpretable linguistic features, many of which were previously used for predicting item difficulty (Ha et al., 2019) and response time  in the domain of clinical MCQs. These features were extracted using code made available by Ha et al. (2019) and to these, we add several predictors specifically related to the medical content of the items, as well as standard item metadata.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Linguistic features", "text": "As noted, this study replicates the feature extraction procedure described and made available by Ha et al. (2019). Approximately 90 linguistic features were extracted from each item's text (the full item including answer options) and are summarized in Table 2. They span several levels of linguistic processing including surface lexical and syntactic features, semantic features that account for ambiguity, and cognitively motivated features that capture properties such as imageability and familiarity. Common readability formulae are used to account for surface reading difficulty. The organization of ideas in the text is captured through text cohesion features that measure the number and types of connective words within an item. Finally, word frequency features (including threshold frequencies) measure the extent to which items utilize frequent vocabulary.\nCombinations of these features have the potential to capture different aspects of item content that are relevant to response complexity. For example, medical terms can be expected to have lower absolute frequencies and familiarity ratings, among other characteristics, and combinations of these features may suggest a higher density of medical terms and specialized language in some items compared to others. Another example is the temporal organization of the information about the patient history and symptoms described in the item and captured by temporal connectives, where it is reasonable to expect that more temporally intricate cases would require higher response process complexity to solve. Similarly, a high number of causal connectives would indicate a higher complexity of causal relationships among the events that led to the patient seeing a doctor, which may also be associated with higher cognitive demands.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Clinical content features", "text": "This group of features relates to the medical content of the items by mapping terms and phrases in the text to medical concepts contained in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus (Schuyler et al., 1993)   the item contains (note that a given term found in the items can refer to multiple UMLS concepts). First, we ask: how many of the words and phrases in the items are medical terms? This information is captured by UMLS Terms Count, indicating the number of terms in an item that appear in the UMLS wherein each instance of a given term contributes to the total count, as well as UMLS Distinct Terms Count: the number of terms in an item that appear in the UMLS wherein multiple instances of a given term contribute only once to the total count. The same kinds of counts are done for medical phrases -UMLS Phrases Count refers to the number of phrases in an item. For example, Metamap maps 'ocular complications of myasthenia gravis' to two phrases: the noun phrase 'ocular complications' and the prepositional phrase 'of myasthenia gravis' (Aronson, 2001).\nNext, we introduce features that measure the ambiguity of medical terms within the items. These include Average Number of Competing UMLS Concepts Per Term Count, which captures the average number of UMLS concepts that a term could be referring to, averaged for all terms in an item, and weighted by the number of times Metamap returns the term. A similar version of this feature but without weighting by the number of times Metamap returns the term is Average Number of UMLS Concepts Per Term Count. This metric is then computed at the level of sentences and items, resulting in: Average Number of UMLS Concepts per Sentence, which measures the medical ambigu-ity of sentences and UMLS Concept Count, which measures item medical ambiguity through the total number of UMLS concepts all terms in an item could refer to.

As could be expected, the majority class of low-complexity items was predicted more accurately than the highcomplexity class, as shown by the confusion matrix in Table 4. An interesting observation was made during a follow-up classification experiment, which showed that this effect remained when using balanced classes 4 . This shows that the success in predicting this class cannot be attributed solely to its prevalence but potentially also to its high homogeneity compared to the high-complexity class.  Next, we plot the model errors across the two classes of low-complexity and high-complexity items, as shown in Figure 3. Notably, items with average response times below 150 seconds were predicted as low-complexity most of the time, with minimal consideration of their p-value. This shows that what the model effectively learned was to distinguish between items with long and short mean response times, which overpowered its ability to predict the p-value parameter. This finding is consistent with previous work, where response times in  were predicted more successfully than p-value using a similar set of linguistic features in Ha et al. (2019). Finally, analysis of the feature distributions across these four classes revealed no unexpected patterns.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The results presented in the previous section lead to three main findings: i) the linguistic characteristics of the items carry signal relevant to response 4 Classes were balanced using the balanced subample setting of the class weight parameter in Scikit-learn's RandomForrestClassifier process complexity; ii) no individual features stand out as strong predictors, and iii) the most important features were those related to syntax and semantics.\nThe first of these findings relates to the fact that the linguistic characteristics of the items carry signal that is predictive of response process complexity, revealing that the problems posed by lowcomplexity and high-complexity items are described using slightly different language. While this signal outperformed several baselines, the overall low predictive utility of the models suggests that there are other factors, yet to be captured, that have a significant effect on response process complexity.\nThe retention of 56 features indicates that individual linguistic predictors provide a weak classification signal but, taken together, they complement each other in a way that ultimately provides a higher accuracy. The fact that there are many predictive features with none standing out is also a positive evaluation outcome for item writing quality, as it shows that the response process complexity associated with an item is not distributed along a small number of linguistic parameters.\nThe most important features that helped with classification were those related to syntax and semantics (Figure 2). The poor performance of the Word Count baseline suggests that differences in response process complexity cannot be explained solely by item length and that more complex linguistic features capture some of the nuance in the response process. As can be seen in Figure 2, high-complexity items contain a slightly higher number of UMLS phrases and (distinct) medical terms, as well as a higher number of unique words. These features suggest high-complexity items re- peat words less frequently and may contain a higher concentration of new information and specialized terminology than low-complexity items. The individual phrases in high-complexity items are also slightly longer, which naturally influences readability metrics that are based on word and sentence length, such as the Automated Readability Index (higher values are indicative of a more complex text). Prepositional phrases were also identified as more important than other phrase types in distinguishing between response process complexity. Prepositional phrases often serve as modifiers of the primary noun phrase and the higher number of prepositional phrases in the high-complexity items suggests the use of more specific descriptions (e.g., \"small cell carcinoma of the ovary\" instead of just \"small cell carcinoma\"). The words contained in the high-complexity items also have slightly higher concreteness levels, providing another indication that they may contain more terms, as terms tend to be more concrete than common words. Finally, the words contained in the high-complexity items also tend to have more possible meanings, as indicated by the polysemous word count variable, which results in higher complexity owing to disambiguation efforts. Overall, these features indicate that the language used in the low-complexity items is less ambiguous and descriptive, and potentially contains fewer medical terms.\nOne limitation of the study is the fact that it treats item difficulty and time intensiveness as independent variables. This may not always be the case, as examinees do employ strategies to optimize their time. Given finite time limits, examinees may ig-nore time intensive items if they believe the time needed for such items can be better utilized attempting other, less time intensive items. Therefore, the relationship between difficulty and response time and their association with item text would differ for exams that do not impose strict time limits.\nWhen using data-driven approaches to defining item classes, our data did not lend itself to a categorization that would allow investigating high difficulty/low response time items and vice-versa. While the approach taken in this paper has a higher ecological validity, studying such cases in the future may lead to a greater understanding of various aspects of response process complexity and their relationship to item text. Other future work includes exploration of potential item position effects.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The experiments presented in this paper are, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation of the relationship between item text and response process complexity. The results showed that such a relationship exists. To the extent that items were written as clearly and as concisely as possible, the findings suggest that high-complexity medical items generally include longer phrases, more medical terms, and more specific descriptions.\nWhile the models outperformed several baselines, they required a large number of features to do so and the predictive utility remained low. Ultimately, this shows the challenging nature of modeling response process complexity using interpretable models and the lack of a straightforward way to manipulate this item property.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "A similarity-based theory of controlling mcq difficulty", "journal": "IEEE", "year": "2013", "authors": "Tahani Alsubait;
