We focus on a specific domain, specifically Japanese blogs on driving, and construct two wide-coverage datasets as a form of QA using crowdsourcing: a PAS-QA dataset and a reading comprehension QA (RC-QA) dataset. We train a machine comprehension (MC) model based on these datasets to perform PAS analysis. Our experiments show that a stepwise training method is the most effective, which pre-trains an MC model based on the RC-QA dataset to acquire domain knowledge and then fine-tunes based on the PAS-QA dataset.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "To understand the meaning of a sentence or a text, it is essential to analyze relations between a predicate and its arguments. Such analysis is called semantic role labeling (SRL) or predicate-argument structure (PAS) analysis. For English, the accuracy of SRL has reached approximately 80%-90% (Ouchi et al., 2018;Strubell et al., 2018;Tan et al., 2018). However, there are many omissions of arguments in Japanese, and the accuracy of Japanese PAS analysis on omitted arguments is still around 50%-60% (Shibata et al., 2016;Shibata and Kurohashi, 2018;Kurita et al., 2018;Ouchi et al., 2017). A reason for such low accuracy is the shortage of gold datasets and knowledge about PAS analysis, which require a prohibitive cost of creation (Iida et al., 2007;Kawahara et al., 2002).\nFrom the viewpoint of text understanding, machine comprehension (MC) has been actively studied in recent years. In MC studies, QA datasets consisting of triplets of a document, a question and * The current affiliation is Yahoo Japan Corporation.\nits answer are constructed, and an MC model is trained using these datasets (e.g., Rajpurkar et al. (2016) and Trischler et al. (2017)). MC has made remarkable progress in the last couple of years, and MC models have even exceeded human accuracy in some datasets (Devlin et al., 2019). However, MC accuracy is not necessarily high for documents that contain anaphoric phenomena and those that need external knowledge or inference (Mihaylov et al., 2018;.\nIn this paper, we propose a Japanese PAS analysis method based on the MC framework for a specific domain. In particular, we focus on a challenging task of finding an antecedent of a zero pronoun within PAS analysis. We construct a widecoverage QA dataset for PAS analysis (PAS-QA) in the domain and feed it to an MC model to perform PAS analysis. We also construct a QA dataset for reading comprehension (RC-QA) in the same domain and jointly use the two datasets in the MC model to improve PAS analysis.\nWe consider the domain of blogs on driving because of the following two reasons. Firstly, we can construct high-quality QA datasets in a short time using crowdsourcing. Crowdworkers can interpret driving blog articles based on the traffic commonsense shared by the society. Secondly, if computers can understand driving situations correctly by extracting driving behavior from blogs, it is possible to predict danger and warn drivers to achieve safer transportation.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows.\n\u2022  FitzGerald et al. (2018) and  constructed QA-SRL Bank 2.0 and QAMRs using crowdsourcing, respectively. They asked crowdworkers to generate question-answer pairs that represent a PAS. These datasets are similar to our PAS-QA dataset, but different in that we focus on omitted arguments and automatically generate questions (see Section 3.1). Many RC-QA datasets have been constructed in recent years. For example, Rajpurkar et al. (2016) constructed SQuAD 1.1, which contains 100K crowdsourced questions and answer spans in a Wikipedia article. Rajpurkar et al. (2018) updated SQuAD 1.1 to 2.0 by adding unanswerable questions. Some RC-QA datasets have been built in a specific domain (Welbl et al., 2017;Suster and Daelemans, 2018;Pampari et al., 2018).", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Machine Comprehension Models", "text": "Many MC models based on neural networks have been proposed to solve RC-QA datasets. For example, Devlin et al. (2019) proposed an MC model using a language representation model, BERT, which achieved a high-ranked accuracy on the SQuAD 1.1 leaderboard as of September 30, 2019.\nAs a previous study of transfer learning of MC models to other tasks, Pan et al. (2018) pre-trained an MC model using an RC-QA dataset and transfered the pre-trained knowledge to sequence-tosequence models. They used SQuAD 1.1 as the RC-QA dataset and experimented on translation and summarization. While they used different models for pre-training and fine-tuning, we use the same MC model by constructing PAS-QA and RC-QA datasets in the same QA form.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "QA Dataset Construction", "text": "We construct PAS-QA and RC-QA datasets in the driving domain.

We  focus on the ga case (nominative), the wo case (accusative), and the ni case (dative), which are targeted in the Japanese PAS analysis literature (Shibata et al., 2016;Shibata and Kurohashi, 2018;Kurita et al., 2018;Ouchi et al., 2017).\nAs a source corpus, we use blog articles included in the Driving Experience Corpus (Iwai et al., 2019). We first detect a predicate that has an omitted argument of either of the target three cases by applying the existing PAS analyzer KNP 1 to the corpus. KNP tends to overgenerate such predicates, but most erroneous ones are filtered out by the following crowdsourcing step. We extract the sentence that contains the predicate and preceding three sentences as a document. Then, we automatically generate a question using the following template for nominative.\n\u2022  \"author,\" \"other,\" and \"not sure.\" The details of this procedure are described in the appendix. We generated questions from 2,146 blog articles. We asked five crowdworkers per question using Yahoo! crowdsourcing 2 . We adopted triplets with three or more votes if they are not \"not sure.\" For accusative and dative PAS-QA questions, we adopted triplets if they are \"other.\" In this case, there is not any antecedent of a zero pronoun in a document, and the answer is \"NULL.\" For nominative PAS-QA questions, we did not adopt triplets if they are \"other\" because a nominative always exists as a noun in a document or \"author.\" In addition, because \"author\" is not explicitly expressed in the document, we add a sentence \" \" (The author wrote the following document.) to the beginning of the document to deal with \"author\" in MC models. We record the answers as spans in a document or NULL.\nWe randomly extracted 100 questions for each case from the PAS-QA dataset and judged whether we can answer them. As a result, 97% nominative, 87% accusative and 68% dative questions were answerable. For accusative and dative, we checked all the questions and chose answerable ones. Finally, we created 12,468 nominative, 3,151 accusative and 1,069 dative triplets including 476 accusative and 126 dative questions whose answers are NULL.

We randomly extracted 200 questions from the RC-QA dataset and judged the question types. The result is shown in Table 2.

We trained a Japanese pre-trained BERT model using Japanese Wikipedia, which consists of approximately 18 million sentences. The input sentences were segmented into words by JUMAN++, and words were broken into subwords by applying BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016). The parameters of BERT are the same as English BERT BASE . The number of epochs for the pre-training was 30.\nThe state-of-the-art baseline PAS analyzer, NN-PAS, was trained using the existing PAS dataset, KWDLC 4 (Kyoto University Web Document Leads Corpus), as described in Shibata and Kurohashi (2018). We also trained an NN-PAS model using the PAS-QA dataset in addition to KWDLC (hereafter, NN-PAS \u2032 ). For this training, the PAS-QA dataset was converted to the same format as KWDLC, where questions are deleted, and only answers are used.\nThe PAS-QA test data is used to compare the baseline methods with the proposed methods.

In the future, we will pre-train an MC model based on datasets other than the RC-QA dataset to acquire domain knowledge.\nA Details of PAS-QA Dataset Construction\nWe construct the PAS-QA dataset asking for omitted nominative arguments using the following procedure:\n1. We extract four consecutive sentences that satisfy the following conditions from the Driving Experience Corpus constructed by Iwai et al. (2019).\n\u2022 The Driving Experience extracting CRF tool (Iwai et al., 2018) judges that three or more sentences out of four sentences are driving experience. \u2022 Each sentence contains at least one PAS.\n\u2022 The PAS analyzer, KNP, judges that there is a PAS whose nominative argument is omitted in the fourth sentence. \u2022 Sentences include at least one \"Driving Characteristic Word\" (Iwai et al., 2019). 2. We automatically make crowdsourcing tasks using an extracted document and a PAS whose nominative argument is omitted (See Figure 5 and Figure 6). Each task consists of a document, a question and answer choices. Answer choices consist of nouns extracted from the document and special symbols, \"author,\" \"other,\" and \"not sure.\" For nominative PAS-QA questions, the special symbol \"author\" can often be an answer, but it is not explicitly expressed in the document. So we add it to the choices. We add \"other\" so that it can be selected when there is an appropriate answer besides the choices. We add \"not sure\" so that workers can select it if they cannot find an answer. We add more explanations to crowdsourcing answer screen (See Figure 5 and Figure 6). 3. Using crowdsourcing, we ask five crowdworkers per question to select one or more appropriate answers from the choices. We asked five crowdworkers per question using Yahoo! crowdsourcing. We adopted triplets with three or more votes if they are not \"not sure.\" If they are \"other,\" we handled them as described in the main paper. We finally record the answers as spans in a document or NULL.
