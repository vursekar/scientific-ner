These three modalities together make it easier for humans to convey emotion and sentiment. Thus, a machine learning model for sentiment analysis needs to learn the features and interactions of all three modalities. For example, a frown in the video can alter the emotion expressed in the text transcript, or audio intensity can help determine if a speaker is getting agitated.\nMultimodal learning has recently received a good deal of attention from the natural language processing community [Sun et al., 2016, Chen et al., 2018, Pham et al., 2019. The Transformer network [Vaswani et al., 2017], with its self-attention modules, has achieved strong performance in multimodal learning; attention provides a natural way to model the relationship between pairs of modalities.\nIn this work we investigate three small, lightweight, Transformer-based architectures for multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recog-nition. Our first model is an implementation of the Late Fusion model commonly used as a baseline system, which assigns individual Transformer blocks to each of the three modalities for feature extraction and then combines these unimodal features to learn cross-modal interactions. The second model is an implementation of the Round Robin approach; the model generates bimodal features by using cross-modal attention to combine pairs of modalities, one pair at a time. Our last model is a Hybrid of the early and late fusion schemes. This model merges the features extracted using a late fusion pipeline, as well as those from an early fusion pipeline, where the three modalities are concatenated and passed through a single Transformer block for feature extraction;.\nWe present experiments using these three models on three multimodal datasets: IEMOCAP [Busso et al., 2008], an emotion recognition dataset, and CMU-MOSI [Zadeh et al., 2016] and CMU-MOSEI [Zadeh et al., 2018b], two multimodal sentiment analysis datasets. Our results show that our small models are competitive with state-of-the-art models that use much more complex architectures.\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We present three lightweight architectures for multimodal sentiment analysis that achieve comparable results to much larger, state-ofthe-art models.\n\u2022 We analyze the effect of removing or simplifying components of state-of-the-art multimodal architectures.\n\u2022 We conduct experiments on small training sets, demonstrating the ability of our lightweight architectures to leverage limited training data and computational resources.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "We do not give an exhaustive list of prior work in multimodal sentiment analysis, but focus on recent neural approaches that achieved state-of-the-art performance at their times of publication.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Recurrent Network Approaches", "text": "The Memory Fusion Network (MFN) of Zadeh et al.

The Recurrent Attended Variation Embedding Network (RAVEN) of Wang et al. [2019] encodes the audio and video features using two recurrent neural networks; these features are combined with the textual input using cross-modal attention in a Gated Modality Mixing Network. The Multi-Attention Recurrent Network (MARN) of Zadeh et al. [2018c] is an LSTM-based architecture that stores representations of each of the three modalities, which are then combined using a multi-attention block. Finally, the Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN) of Pham et al.

However, existing architectures are very dense compared to our three lightweight models. The Multimodal Transformer (MuLT) of Tsai et al. [2019] modifies the Transformer block to compute cross-modal attention for two modalities at a time. It combines modalities in directed pairs, using a total of six Transformers, whose outputs are then merged into a single multimodal representation. Unlike other works, MuLT is able to handle cases where the three modalities are not aligned at the word level; it learns soft alignments via the cross-modal attention weights for each pair of modalities. The model works well in the unaligned case, and in the aligned case, it gives state of the art performance the Happy emotion in IEMO-CAP.\nThe Factorized Multimodal Transformer (FMT)\nof  introduces Factorized Multimodal Self-Attention (FSM) modules, which compute self-attention over unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal inputs in parallel. FMT gives state of the art performance in the word-aligned case on CMU-MOSI and on the Sad, Angry, and Neutral emotions in IEMOCAP.

Each of the three modalities has its own lowlevel features, such as the Mel spectrogram for audio or facial landmarks for video. These features are extracted at different sampling rates -one set of features per word or character for text, per millisecond for audio, and per frame for video -and thus the input sequences for the three modalities are often different. A five-thousand-millisecond audio sequence, for example, may be only a three-word sequence from a textual perspective and a 50-frame sequence from a video perspective.\nWe align the audio and video to the text using the timestamps provided in the text transcripts.

Table 5 shows the results of our models, as well as MuLT* and FMT*, retrained on this smaller IEMOCAP training set, and evaluated on the full IEMOCAP test set.

Table 6 presents the results of modality ablation on the simplest Late Fusion model; it clearly shows that unimodal and bimodal models are unable to match the performance of a full multimodal model. This demonstrates the importance of considering all modalities when analyzing spoken language, since some of the emotions or sentiment may be dependent more on the audio or the visual actions of the speaker, rather than the text.\nExamining the unimodal results, we see that the Text modality is the most informative for predicting Happy, Sad, and Neutral, while Audio is the most informative for Angry. However, the bimodal results do not always match the unimodal results. The best-performing bimodal model for Happy is [V,A], despite Video being the worst-performing single modality, and [T,A] is the worst-performing bimodal model, despite both Text and Audio outperforming Video individually. Considering the other three emotions, we see that the best bimodal model varies between [T,A] and [V,A], with [T,V] generally performing the worst.\nTable 7 shows the results of modality ablation on the Round Robin model; as the architecture does not support unimodal experiments, only bimodal results are shown. Comparing Table 6 to Table 7, we see that the cross-modal Transformers of the full Round Robin model are outperformed by the full Late Fusion model. However, the relative performance among modality pairs is consistent across Tables 6 and 7.\nFinally, Table 8 shows the results of modality ablation on the Hybrid Fusion model, where we compare the relative contributions of the early fusion and late fusion halves of the architecture. The top of the table shows the results of reducing the early fusion half to only two modalities while retaining all three modalities in the late fusion half, and the bottom shows the results of reducing the late fusion half to two modalities while retaining all three in the early fusion half; in both sets of experiments, the overall model has access to all three modalities, but only through either the early fusion path or the late fusion path. Surprisingly, although standalone early fusion models are outperformed by standalone late fusion models [Tsai et al., 2019], we find that a hybrid model containing a full, trimodal early fusion half is more robust to modality ablation in its late fusion half than a model with a full late fusion half is to an ablated early fusion half. Our results in this experiment also show greater variability among modality pairs. The [T,A] combination, which gave the best performance in the Late Fusion and Round Robin experiments, remains the strongest modality pair for the full early fusion, bimodal late fusion model. In contrast, for the bimodal early fusion, full late fusion model, [T,A] is outperformed by one of the two Video-based modality pairs, [T,V] or [V,A], on each of the four emotions, suggesting that the performance gap of early versus late fusion differs across modalities.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Order of Modalities in Round Robin", "text": "The effect of direction on our Round Robin model is shown in Table 9; this experiment shows the impact of the direction of information flow across modalities within the model.

We can also see that the direction does matter; the performance of the Round Robin model with information flowing in the opposite direction, from video to audio to text and back to video, is relatively poor.
