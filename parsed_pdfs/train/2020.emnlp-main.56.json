In this paper, we propose a novel Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural Language Generation (AC-NLG) method, consisting of an attentional encoder and a pair of innovative counterfactual decoders.

Such imbalance in D(J) leads to the confounding bias that the representations of I and V tend to be supportive, and blind the conventional training on P (V |I).\n2019). Court's view can be regarded as the interpretation for the sentence of a case. Being an important portion of verdict, court's view is difficult to generate due to its logic reasoning in the content. Therefore court's view generation is regarded as one of the most critical functions in a legal assistant system. Court's view consists of two main parts, including the judgment and the rationales, where the judgment is a response to the plaintiff's claims in civil cases or charges in criminal cases, and the rationales are summarized from the fact description to derive and explain the judgment.\nRecently, Ye et al. (2018) investigated the problem of court's view generation for the criminal cases, but it focused on the generation of rationales in the court's view based on the given criminal charge and fact description of a case. Such an experimental scenario is not applicable to the practical situation since the rationales should be concluded before reaching the final judgment. Moreover, dif-Figure 2: An example of plaintiff's claim, fact description, and court's view from a legal document in a civil case. The judgment is non-support since there exists a rejection on one of the plaintiff's claims in the court's view. ferent from the criminal cases, in civil cases, the judgment depends not only on the facts recognized but also on the claims that the plaintiff declared.\nIn this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically generating the court's view in civil cases by injecting the plaintiff's claim and fact description, as shown in Fig. 2. In such a context, the problem of the court's view generation can be formulated as a text-to-text natural language generation (NLG) problem, where the input is the plaintiff's claim and the fact description, and the output is the corresponding court's view that contains the judgment and the rationales 1 . Although classical text generative models (e.g., sequence-tosequence model Sutskever et al., 2014, attentionbased model, andpointer-generator networks See et al., 2017) have been applied to many text generation tasks, yet, in the task of the court's view generation, such techniques cannot be simply applied for the following reasons: (1) There exists \"no claim, no trial\" principle in civil legal systems: The judgment in the real court's view is the response to the claims declared by the plaintiff, where its rationales summarize the corresponding facts. In other words, there exists a correspondence relationship between the input (claims and facts) and the generated text (court's view). For example, the plaintiff's claims shown in Fig. 2 mentioned the principal and the interest, respectively. Hence, the court's view of this case would and might only focus on the facts about the principal and the interest. (2) The imbalance of judgment in civil cases: The distribution of judgment results of civil cases is very imbalanced. For example, over 76% of cases were supported in private lending, which is the most frequent category in civil cases. Such an imbalance of judgment would blind the training of the model by focusing on the supported cases while ignoring the non-supported cases, leading to incorrect judgment generation of court's view.\nFrom the perspective of causality (Pearl, 2009;Kuang et al., 2020), the imbalance of judgment reveals the confounding bias induced by the data generation mechanism that plaintiffs sue when they have a high probability to be supported. Such imbalanced data would cause the learned representation of both inputs (claims and recognized facts) and output (court's view) to be supported, leading to confounding bias between inputs and output, and blinding the training process of conventional NLG models as we demonstrated in Fig. 1.\nTo address these challenges, we propose an Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural Language Generation (AC-NLG) method by jointly optimizing a claim-aware encoder, a pair of counterfactual decoders to generate judgmentdiscriminative court's views (both supportive and non-supportive views) and a synergistic judgment predictive model. Specifically, the claim-aware encoder is designed to represent the fact description which emphasizes on the declared claims. The counterfactual decoder is inspired by the backdoor adjustment in causal inference (Pearl et al., 2016;Kuang et al., 2020) to address the confounding bias and the imbalance problem in judgment. To determine the judgment result of each case, a judgment predictive model is jointly learned with the two decoders and decides which output to be selected as the final generated court's view. We validate the effectiveness of our AC-NLG method with extensive experiments on real legal documents. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method under both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics.\nSince legal AI is a sensitive field, we make ethical discussion in the penultimate section(Sec. 6).\nThe main contributions of this paper can be sum-marized as follows:\n\u2022 We investigate the problem of de-biased court's view generation in civil cases from a causal perspective, considering the issue of confounding bias from judgment imbalance.\n\u2022 We propose a novel AC-NLG model to jointly optimize a claim-aware encoder and a pair of counterfactual decoders for generating a judgment-discriminative court's view by incorporating with a judgment predictive model.\n\u2022 We construct a dataset based on raw civil legal documents, where each case is objectively split into three parts: plaintiff's claim, fact description, and court's view with human annotation on the judgment. To motivate other scholars to investigate this novel but important problem, we make the experiment dataset publicly available 2 .\n\u2022 We validate the superior performance of the proposed method with extensive experiments. Our method can be applied to other natural language generation tasks with confounding bias or data imbalance.\n2 Related Work", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 5}, {"heading": "Legal Assistant", "text": "In recent years, many researchers from both law and computer science fields have been exploring the potential and methods to perform judicial decisions and auxiliary tasks, aiming at helping lawyers and lower court judges.

We formulate our problem with the definition of the plaintiff's claim, the fact description, and the court's view, as shown in Fig. 2. Plaintiff's claim (C) is a descriptive sentence that depicts the claims from the plaintiff. In a civil case, it often appears multiple claims from the plaintiff. For example, the plaintiff's claim demonstrated in Fig. 2 contains the principal claim and the interest claim. Here, we denote the plaintiff's claim in a case as a sentence form c = {w c t } m t=1 , where w c t represents one word, and m is the number of words in plaintiff's claim.\nFact description (F) is also a descriptive sentence, which describes the identified facts (relevant events that have happened) in a case, as Fig. 2 shows. Here, we denote the fact description in a case as f = {w f t } n t=1 , where n is the length. Court's view (V) contains two main components, judgment and rationales, where the judgment is to respond the plaintiff's claims, and the rationales are the claim-related summarization on the fact description to determine and interpret the judgment. Here, we denote the court's view as v = {w v t } l t=1 , where l is the length. Moreover, we use a variable j to denote the judgment in the court's view. For simplicity, we set j = 1 to denote supported judgment (all the claims are judged to be accepted), and j = 0 to denote non-supported judgment.\nThen, the problem of court's view generation can be denoted as follow:\nProblem 1 (Court's View Generation). Given the plaintiff's claim c = {w c t } m t=1 and the fact de- scription f = {w f t } n t=1 , our task is to generate the court's view v = {w v t } l t=1 .", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 3}, {"heading": "Method", "text": "In this section, we first introduce the effect of mechanism confounding bias on the court's view generation and propose a backdoor-inspired method to eliminate that bias.

For a certain case, given the input I = (c, f ), using Bayes rule, we would train the model to generate the court's view V as follow:\nP (V |I) = j P (V |I, j)P (j|I)(1)\nIf the supported cases dominate our training data, e.g., P (j = 1|I) \u2248 1. Thus, P (V |I) degrades to P (V |I, j = 1), which would ignore the representation of non-supported cases, leading to the learned representations of inputs I and output V tend to be supported. Thus, the model tends to build a strong connection between inputs and the supported court's view, even for the cases that are non-supported. In this way, the representation of input I is contaminated by the confounding bias\nfrom I \u2190 D(J) \u2192 V .\nBackdoor adjustment is a main de-confounding technique in causal inference (Pearl et al., 2016;Pearl, 2009). De-confounding seeks the exact causal effect of one variable on another, which appeals for our court's view generation task since the court's view should be faithful only to the content of the plaintiff's claims and fact descriptions.\nThe backdoor adjustment makes a do-operation on I, which promotes the posterior probability from passive observation to active intervention.\nThe backdoor adjustment addresses the confounding bias by computing the interventional posterior P (V |do(I)) and controlling the confounder as:\nP (V |do(I)) = j P (V |I, j)P (j) (2)\nIn our problem, the variable j is a binary variable (support or non-support), hence, P (V |do(I)) = P (V |I, j = 0)P (j = 0) + P (V |I, j = 1)P (j = 1)\nThe main difference between traditional posterior in Eq. 1 and interventional posterior in Eq. 2 is that P (j|I) is changed to P (j). Since the backdooor adjustment help to cut the dependence between D(J) and I, we can eliminate the confounding bias from data generation mechanism and learn a interventional model for de-biased court's view generation.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Backdoor In Implementation", "text": "As shown in Fig. 3, to optimize Eq. 3, we use a pair of counterfactual decoders to learn the likelihood P (V |I, j) for each j.

The predictor and the decoders take the output of the encoder as input. Our model looks like SHAPED(Zhang et al., 2018) (several decoders with a classifier), but the motivations and mechanisms behind the model are different.\nClaim-aware Encoder Intuitively, the plaintiff's claim c and the fact description f are sequences of words. Therefore, the encoder firstly transforms the words to embeddings. Then the embedding sequences are fed to the Bi-LSTM, producing two sequences of hidden states h c , h f corresponding to the plaintiff's claim and the fact description respectively.\nAfter that, we use a claim-aware attention mechanism to fuse h c and h f . For each hidden state h f i in h f , e i k is its attention weight on h c k , and the attention distribution q i is calculated as follow:\ne i k = v T tanh(W c h c k + W f h f i + b attn ) (4) q i = sof tmax(e i )(5)\nwhere v, W c , W f , b attn are learnable parameters.\nThe attention distribution can be regarded as the importance of each word in the plaintiff's claim for a word in fact description. Next, the new representation of fact description is produced as follows:\nh f * i = h f i + k q i k h c k (6)\nAfter feeding to another Bi-LSTM layer, we get the claim-aware representation of fact h.\nJudgment Predictor Given the claim-aware representation of fact h, the judgment predictor produces the probability of support P sup through a fully connected layer and a sigmoid operation. The prediction result j is obtained as follow:\nj = 1 P sup > 0.5 0 P sup <= 0.5 (7)\nwhere 1 means support, and 0 means non-support.\nCounterfactual Decoder To eliminate the effect of data bias, here we use a pair of counterfactual decoders, which contains two decoders, one is for supported cases, and the other is for non-supported cases. The two decoders have the same structure but aim to generate the court's view with different judgments. We name them as counterfactual decoders because every time there is only one of the two generated court's views correct. Still, we apply the attention-mechanism. At each step t, given the encoder's output h, and the decode state s t , the attention distribution a t is calculated the same way as q i in Eq. 5, but with different parameters. The context vector h * t is then a weighted sum of h:\nh * t = i a t i h i (8)\nThe context vector h * t , which can be regarded as a representation of the input for this step, is concatenated with the decode state s t and fed to linear layers to produce the vocabulary distribution p vocab :\np vocab = sof tmax(V (V [s t , h * t ]) + b) + b ) (9)\nwhere V , V , b, b are all learnable parameters. Then we add a generation probability (See et al., 2017) to solve the OOV problem. Given the context h * t , the decode state s t and the decoder's input (the word embedding of the previous word) x t , the generation probability p gen can be calculated:\nP gen = \u03c3(w T h * h * t + w T s s t + w T x x t + b ptr ) (10)\nwhere w h * , w s , w x and b ptr are learnable, and \u03c3 is the sigmoid function. The final probability for a word w in time step is obtained: Training For predictor, we use cross-entropy as the loss function:\nP (w) = P gen * p vocab (w) + (1 \u2212 P gen ) i:w i =w a t i(\nL pred = \u2212\u0135log(P sup ) \u2212 (1 \u2212\u0135)log(1 \u2212 P sup )\n(12) where\u0135 is the real judgment.\nFor decoders, the previous word in training is the word in real court's view, and the loss for timestep t is the negative log-likelihood of the target word\nw * t : L t = \u2212logP (w * t )(13)\nand the overall generation loss is:\nL gen = 1 T T t=0 L t (14\n)\nwhere T is the length of real court's view. Since we aim to make the two decoders generate two different court's views, we take a mask operation when calculating the loss of each decoder. The exact loss for the support decoder is:\nL sup = L gen\u0135 = 1 0\u0135 = 0 (15)\nthe loss for the non-support decoder L nsup is obtained by the opposite way. Thus, the total loss is:\nL total = L sup + L nsup + \u03bbL pred (16\n)\nwhere we set \u03bb to 0.1 in our model.\nInference In inference, the counterfactual decoders apply beam search to generate two court's views, and one of them will be selected as the final output, depending on the result of the predictor j.

From a fairness perspective, prior studies suggested that global (statistical) optimization = individual (demographic) fairness (Zemel et al., 2013), and this ethical concern should be further investigated. In this section, we explore the following ethical issues.\nTarget User: According to the report of statistics, a typical active trial judge closed around 250 cases in a year. Trial judges suffering from 'daunting workload' is becoming an critical issue (Duan et al., 2019). The proposed algorithm is designed for generating the court's view draft for assisting the trial judges for decision making. This work is an algorithmic investigation, but such algorithm should never 'replace' human judges. Human knowledge/judgment should be the final safeguard to protect social justice and individual fairness.\nPotential Error: The potential error would be as follows: a) generating a wrong judgment and b) generating a wrong rationale. The goal of our algorithm is to generate a draft of court's view for trail judge as a reference, and judges need to proofread the content generated from algorithm.\nDemographic Bias: In this paper, we focus on addressing the bias problem from the data generation by treating the variable of data generation as confounder in back-door adjustment. The model adoption can face potential demographic bias/unfairness challenges, such as gender and race bias in the training data. To further ensure the model fairness, in the future, algorithm adoption should be empowered with de-biased legal content pretraining, which could avoid potential demographic bias. For instance, in order to remove gender/race bias, system could use (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) algorithm to debias the sensitive gender/race information, e.g., replace 'he/she' and 'asian/hispanic' with gender/race neutral words for pretraining, which can be vital for legal domain.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we propose a novel Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural Language Genera-tion (AC-NLG) method to solve the task of court's view generation in civil cases and ensure the fairness of the judgment.

The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.\nBased on the AC-NLG method, in the future, we can explore the following directions: (1) Improve the accuracy of judgment on a claim-level.
