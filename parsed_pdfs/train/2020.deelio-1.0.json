The DeeLIO workshop aims to bring together the knowledge interpretation, extraction and integration lines of research in deep learning, and cover the area in between. We hope that the DeeLIO workshop will become a regular forum for the exchange of ideas and will contribute to foster collaboration within these research fields. This volume includes the 11 papers presented at the workshop. DeeLIO was co-located with the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2020) and was held on November 19, 2020 as an online workshop, following the exceptional \"new normal\" circumstances of 2020.\nFor the first edition of the workshop, we received 21 paper submissions. We accepted 11 papers (acceptance rate 52.4%) which were presented at the workshop. The accepted papers cover both thematic aspects of DeeLIO: the extraction of linguistic knowledge from deep neural models and the integration of knowledge from external resources, for different languages and applications. In addition to the regular workshop papers, the first edition of DeeLIO also included presentations of several papers from the EMNLP companion volume 'Findings of EMNLP' which were thematically relevant to the workshop goals. There was no distinction between oral and poster presentations this year, and all presentations involved pre-recorded talks accompanied with individual live Q&A sessions.\nWe take this opportunity to thank the DeeLIO program committee for their thorough reviews. We also thank the authors who presented their work at DeeLIO, and the workshop participants for the valuable feedback and discussions. Finally, we are honored to have two excellent invited talks from our invited speakers Ellie Pavlick and Eduard Hovy.
