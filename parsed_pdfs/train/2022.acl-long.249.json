To better understand this complex and understudied task, we study the functional structure of long-form answers collected from three datasets, ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019), We-bGPT (Nakano et al., 2021)  and Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). Our main goal is to understand how humans organize information to craft complex answers. We develop an ontology of six sentence-level functional roles for long-form answers, and annotate 3.9k sentences in 640 answer paragraphs. Different answer collection methods manifest in different discourse structures. We further analyze model-generated answers -finding that annotators agree less with each other when annotating model-generated answers compared to annotating human-written answers. Our annotated data enables training a strong classifier that can be used for automatic analysis. We hope our work can inspire future research on discourselevel modeling and evaluation of long-form QA systems. 1   ", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "While many information seeking questions can be answered by a short text span, requiring a short span answer significantly limits the types of questions that can be addressed as well as the extent of information that can be conveyed. Recent work (Fan et al., 2019;Krishna et al., 2021;Nakano et al., 2021) explored long-form answers, where answers are free-form texts consisting of multiple sentences. Such long-form answers provide flexible space where the answerer can provide a nuanced answer, incorporating their confidence and sources of their knowledge. Thus the answer sentences form a discourse where the answerers provide information, hedge, explain, provide examples, point to other sources, and more; these elements need to be structured and organized coherently.\nWe take a linguistically informed approach to understand the structure of long-form answers, designing six communicative functions of sentences in long-form answers (which we call roles). 2 Our framework combines functional structures with the notion of information salience by designating a role for sentences that convey the main message of an answer. Other roles include signaling the organization of the answer, directly answering the question, giving an example, providing background information, and so on. About a half of the sentences in long-form answers we study serve roles other than providing an answer to the question.\nWe collect discourse annotations on three long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets, ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019), WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) and Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). Figure 1 contains an example annotation on each dataset. While all three contain paragraph-length answers needed for complex queries, they are collected in distinct mannersanswers in ELI5 are written by Reddit users; answers in WebGPT are written by annotators who searched documents on a web interface and heavily quoted those documents to form an answer, and answers in NQ are pre-existing paragraphs from Wikipedia corpus. We collect three-way annotations for 3.9k sentences (\u223c700 question-answer pairs across three datasets). We also annotate a small number of model-generated answers from a recent long-form question answering (LFQA) system (Krishna et al., 2021) and provide rich analysis of their discourse structure.\nIn all three datasets, we observe appearance of most proposed functional roles, but with different proportions. Answers in ELI5 contains more examples and elaborations, while answers extracted WebGPT: How much money is needed in order to not have to work for the rest of your life?\nI worked on a window-washing robot that cleaned acres of rooftops over a huge commercial greenhouse. Worked great, except when it didn't, and would either break down completely or just get lost and start climbing the wrong parts of the structure.\nThen repair techs and manual window washers still have to be employed. I think this ends up being a cost/benefit problem where the reliability of our robots and price of implementation isn't quite at the point where it m a k e s t h i s c o m m e r c i a l l y v i a b l e f o r skyscrapers. For what it's worth, I think the Twin Towers actually used a washer robot on the upper floors to limited success.\nTo determine how much money you need to never have to work again for the rest of your life, some calculation is needed to arrive at a dollar number tailored to you [2]. You need to consider the amount you spend yearly, the effect of inflation on your savings, and the income you need from an investment portfolio to keep ahead of inflation.\n[1][3] A reliable savings range is your current yearly spending multiplied by 28 to 36, with more security and comfort the higher the number is. from Wikipedia passages (NQ) contain more auxiliary information. Analyzing a subset of ELI5 and WebGPT, we also identify a big gap in lexical overlap between long-form answer and evidence passages across all functional roles. Lastly, we found that human agreement of the discourse roles of model-generated answers are much lower than human-written ones, reflecting the difficulty for humans to process model-generated answers.\nWith the data collected, we present a competitive role classifier, which performs on par with human when trained with our annotated data and can be used for automatic discourse analysis. We further envision using functional roles for controllable long-form generations, concise answer generation, and improved evaluation metrics for LFQA.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Defining Answer Discourse Structure", "text": "We study the discourse structure of long-form answers based on functional roles of sentences in the paragraph. Functional structures characterize the communicative role a linguistic unit plays; as such, they vary across genres as the goals of communication also vary. In scientific or technical articles, these roles can be background, method, findings (Kircz, 1991;Liddy, 1991;Mizuta et al., 2006), while in news, they can be main event or anecdotes (Van Dijk, 2013;Choubey et al., 2020). These structures are related to, though distinct from, coherence discourse structures (Hobbs, 1985). The latter characterizes how each unit (e.g., adjacent clauses or sentences) relates to others through semantic relations such as temporal, causal, etc.; such structures can be trees that hierarchically relate adjacent units (Mann and Thompson, 1988) or graphs (Lascarides and Asher, 2008). In contrast, functional roles describe how information is organized to serve the communication goal, in our case, providing the answer.\nWe developed our ontology by examining longform answers in online community forums (subreddit Explain Like I'm Five (ELI5)) and Wikipedia passages, hence answers derived from different domains (e.g., textbooks) can contain roles beyond our ontology. We describe our six sentence-level discourse roles for long-form answers here: Answer-Summary (Sum), Answer (Ans). An answer sentence directly addresses the question. Here we distinguish between the the main content of the answer (henceforth answer summary) vs. sentences which explain or elaborate on the summary. The summaries play a more salient role than non-summary answer sentences, and can often suffice by themselves as the answer to the question. This is akin to argumentation structure that hierarchically arranges main claims and supporting arguments (Peldszus and Stede, 2013), and news structure that differentiates between main vs. supporting events (Van Dijk, 2013).\nOrganizational sentences (Org.) Rather than conveying information of the answer, the major role of an organizational sentence is to inform the reader how the answer will be structured. We found two main types of such sentences; the first signals an upcoming set of items of parallel importance:\n[A]: There are a few reasons candidates with \"no chance\" to win keep running. 1) They enjoy campaigning [...] The other type indicates that part of the answer is upcoming amidst an established flow; in the example below, the answerer used a hypophora: Examples (Ex.) Often people provide examples in answers; these are linguistically distinct from other answer sentences in the sense that they are more specific towards a particular entity, concept, or situation. This pattern of language specificity can also be found in example-related discourse relations (Louis and Nenkova, 2011;Li and Nenkova, 2015), or through entity instantiation (MacKinlay and Markert, 2011):\n[Q]: What is it about electricity that kills you? [A]: [...] For example, static electricity consists of tens of thousands of volts, but basically no amps. [...] We found that examples in human answers are often not signaled explicitly, and often contain hypothetical situations:\n[Q]: Were major news outlets established with political bias or was it formed over time?\n[A]: [...]This is impossible due to the problem of \"anchoring.\" Consider a world where people on the right want the tax rate to be 1% lower and people on the left want the tax rate to be 1% higher [...] Auxiliary information (Aux.) These sentences provide information that are related to what is discussed in the answer, but not asked in the question. It could be background knowledge that the answerer deemed necessary or helpful, e.g., or related content that extends the question, e.g., [Q]: what is the difference between mandi and kabsa? [A]: [...] A popular way of preparing meat is called mandi. [...] Another way of preparing and serving meat for kabsa is mathbi , where seasoned meat is grilled on flat stones that are placed on top of burning embers.\nNotably, the removal of auxiliary information would still leave the answer itself intact.", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Miscellaneous (Misc.)", "text": "We observe various roles that, although less frequent, show up consistently in human answers. We group them into a miscellaneous role and list them below.\n(a) Some sentences specify the limitation of the answer by narrowing down the scope of the answer to an open-ended question.\n[Q]: Why are there such drastic differences in salaries between different countries? (b) Some sentences state where the answer came from and thus put the answer into context.\n[Q]: Why Does a thermostat require the user to switch between heat and cool modes, as opposed to just setting the desired temperature?\n[A]: The person who installed my heat pump (which has all three modes) explained this to me. [...] (c) Some sentences point to other resources that might contain the answers.

The answers in ELI5 are of varying quality and style. While the original dataset consists of (question, answer) pairs, recent benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021) annotated a subset of examples with relevant Wikipedia paragraphs, which we used for analysis in Section 4. In addition to answers in the original datasets, we annotate a small number of model-generated answers from Krishna et al. (2021) (we refer this set as ELI5-model), a state-ofthe art LFQA system on ELI5.\nWebGPT Nakano et al. (2021) presented a new LFQA dataset and model; with the goal of building a model that can search and navigate the web to compose a long-form answer. While they reuse questions from ELI5, they newly collect answers from trained human annotators who were instructed to first search for related documents using a search engine and then construct the answers with reference to those documents. The collected data (denoted as \"human demonstration\" consisting of question, answer, a set of evidence documents, and mapping from the answer to the evidence document) are used to finetune GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to generate long-form answers.\nNatural Questions (NQ) NQ contains questions from Google search queries, which is paired with a relevant Wikipedia article and an answer in the article if the article answers the question. They annotate paragraph-level answer as well as short span answer inside the paragraph answer if it exists. In open retrieval QA, researchers  filtered questions with paragraph level answers for its 3 We used Stanza (Qi et al., 2020) to split long-form answers into sentences. This process removes 42%, 28% and 34% from ELI5, WebGPT and NQ respectively. 4 Our data is sourced from the validation split of ELI5 from the KILT (Petroni et al., 2021) benchmark, the testing portion from WebGPT (their samples are publicly hosted at https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows. net/webgpt-answer-viewer/index.html, which answers questions from the ELI5 test set), and the validation split from Natural Questions. difficulty of evaluation and only look at questions with short span answer.\nWe create a filtered set of NQ that focuses on paragraph-level answers containing complex queries. 5 While many NQ questions can be answered with a short entity (e.g., how many episodes in season 2 breaking bad?), many others questions require paragraph length answer (e.g., what does the word china mean in chinese?). This provides a complementary view compared to the other two datasets, as the answers are not written specifically for the questions but harvested from pre-written Wikipedia paragraphs. Thus, this simulates scenarios where model retrieves paragraphs instead of generating them.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Annotation Process", "text": "We have a two-stage annotation process: annotators first determine the validity of the QA pair, and proceed to discourse annotation only if they consider the QA pair valid.

Examples of the invalid QA pair identified are in A.1. 6 We collect the first stage annotation from USbased crowdsource workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and second stage annotation from undergraduate students majoring in linguistics, who are native speakers in English. 7 A total of 29 crowdworker participated in our task, and six undergraduates annotated roles for a subset of QA pairs annotated as valid by crowdworkers. We first qualified and then provided training materials to both groups of annotators. The annotation guideline and interface can be found in A.4.

When all annotators chose different roles, they resolved the disagreement through adjudication. We report inter-annotator agreement before the adjudication.\nInter-annotator Agreement We find modest to high agreement for both annotation tasks: For crowdworkers, Fleiss Kappa was 0.51 for validity annotation. For student annotators, Fleiss Kappa was 0.44 for role annotation. Figure 2 shows the confusion matrix between pairs of annotations, with the numbers normalized by row and averaged across pairs of annotators.

NQ has the highest rate of invalid answer (15%). Upon manual inspection, we find that passages from Wikipedia written independently of the question often only partially address complex questions. This demonstrates the limitation of a fully extractive approach.

In contrast, ELI5 contains more answer sentences and examples which provide explanation. Both ELI5 and WebGPT contain organizational sentences, demonstrating that it is commonly used when answerers assemble answers that cover more than one aspects. In all datasets, around half of the sentences serve roles other than directly answering the questions, such as providing auxiliary information or giving an example, which reflects the wide spectrum of information presented in a long-form answer.   sentences. This is partially because both datasets are more extractive and less personal, without sentences which serve the role of various kinds of communication from answerers to question askers (e.g. expressing sentiments, pointing to other resources) that are commonly seen in online community forum.\nDiscourse Structure Figure 3 presents the distribution of each role per its relative location in the answer. Despite the significant differences in the proportion of different discourse roles, the positioning of the roles is similar across the datasets. Answer summary and organizational sentences typically locate at the beginning of the paragraph, examples and answers often in the middle, with an increasing portion of auxiliary information towards the end. The sentences belonging to miscellaneous role frequently position at the beginning or the end of the paragraph, instead of intervening in the middle. WebGPT contains a higher portion of auxiliary information locating at the beginning of the passage, followed by the answer summary sentences.\nAnswer Extractiveness One important aspect for long-form answer is whether the answer can be attributed to an external evidence document. While answers from NQ are directly extracted from Wikipedia passages, both ELI5 and WebGPT are written specifically for the question. To help with verification, both datasets provide evidence documents paired with the answer, and yet there are design differences between the two. Answerer (annotators) of WebGPT were instructed to answer the question based on the evidence documents returned by a search engine, while answers from ELI5 were written first independently and later paired with relevant Wikipedia passages (Petroni et al., 2021).\nWe found that such difference leads to different level of extractiveness of the answer, by calculating sentence-level lexical overlap (after removing stopwords) with the evidence document. Overall, WebGPT answers exhibit more lexical overlap (unigram: 0.64, bigram: 0.36) with evidence document than ELI5 answers (unigram: 0.09, bigram: 0.01). Answer sentences with different roles also exhibit different levels of extractiveness (detailed role-level overlap can be found in Table 8 in the appendix). For ELI5 answers, sentences belonging to answer and summary roles have the highest overlap while example, auxiliary information and miscellaneous sentences are less grounded to external sources.

The Fleiss's kappa of QA pair validity is 0.26 (and 0.61 after collecting one more label), substantially lower than the agreement on human written answers (0.51, 0.70) while annotated by the same set of annotators. Detailed distribution of invalid reason annotated can be found in Table 9. Despite the low agreement, 60 of them are marked as \"No valid answer\" by at least two annotators. The flaw of automatic measures was also pointed out by prior work (Krishna et al., 2021), which compares ROUGE between humanwritten and model-generated answers. Our study reiterates that the generated answers received high ROUGE score without answering the question.\nRoles We proceed to collect sentence-level role annotations on 115 valid generated long-form answers following the same annotation setup in Section 3, and hence our annotators were not asked to evaluate the correctness or the quality of the answers (e.g. whether the generated example makes sense), focusing on the functional roles of sentences only. We found that the annotators disagree substantially more as compared to the humanwritten answers, with a Fleiss kappa of 0.31 (vs. 0.45 for human-written answers), suggesting that the discourse structure of model-generated answers are less clear, even to our trained annotators.\nThe answer role distribution of model-generated answers is very different from that of the human written answers (Figure 4). The generated answers contain more sentences which provide auxiliary information, and fewer summary sentences. This suggests that model-generated answers contain a higher portion of information tangentially related to what is asked in the question.

In scientific writing, content types (e.g., background, methodology) are shown to be useful for summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2002;Cohan et al., 2018), information extraction (Mizuta et al., 2006;Liakata et al., 2012), and information retrieval (Kircz, 1991;Liddy, 1991).

Trained role classifier can also evaluate the discourse structure of model-generated answers. Future work can explore using sentences belonging to the summary role to design evaluation metrics that focuses on the core parts of the answer (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), for assessing the correctness of generated the answer.

To identify complex questions, we built a simple BERT-based classifier, trained to distinguish NQ questions with short answers (i.e., less than five tokens) and ELI5 questions. We use the [CLS] token from BERT model to perform prediction. We use the original split from the ELI5 dataset, and split the NQ open's validation set into val and test set. We preprocessed the questions by converting to lowercase and exclude punctuation to remove syntactic differences between ELI5 and NQ questions. We fine-tuned the bert-base-uncased model for 3 epochs, with an initial learning rate of 5e \u2212 5 and batch size of 32. We use the model with the highest validation F1 as the question classifier, which achieves F1 of 0.97 and 0.94 on validation and test set respectively.
