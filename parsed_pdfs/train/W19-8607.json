Ultimately, however, we expect computers to generate whole new arguments for a given stance towards some topic, backing up claims following argumentative and rhetorical considerations. In this paper, we approach such an argumentation synthesis as a language modeling task. In our language model, argumentative discourse units are the \"words\", and arguments represent the \"sentences\". Given a pool of units for any unseen topic-stance pair, the model selects a set of unit types according to a basic rhetorical strategy (logos vs. pathos), arranges the structure of the types based on the units' argumentative roles, and finally \"phrases\" an argument by instantiating the structure with semantically coherent units from the pool. Our evaluation suggests that the model can, to some extent, mimic the human synthesis of strategy-specific arguments.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Existing research on computational argumentation largely focuses on the analysis side. Various analysis tasks are widely studied including identifying the claims along with their supporting premises (Stab and Gurevych, 2014), finding the relation between argumentative units (Cocarascu and Toni, 2017), and assessing the persuasiveness of arguments (Habernal and Gurevych, 2016).\nDiverse downstream applications, however, necessitate the development of argumentation synthesis technologies. For example, synthesis is needed to produce a summary of arguments for a given topic (Wang and Ling, 2016) or to build a debating system where new arguments are exchanged between the users and the system (Le et al., 2018).\nAs a result, a number of recent studies addresses the argumentation synthesis task. These studies have proposed different approaches to generating claims or reasons for a given topic, partly with a particular stance towards the topic (Bilu and Slonim, 2016;Hua and Wang, 2018). However, the next important synthesis step is still missing in the literature, namely, to generate complete texts including both argumentative and rhetorical considerations. With the latter, we refer to Aristotle's three means of persuasion: logos (providing logical arguments), ethos (demonstrating credibility), and pathos (evoking emotions). As discussed by Wachsmuth et al. (2018), following a rhetorical strategy is key to achieving persuasion with argumentative texts.\nThis paper proposes a new computational approach that synthesizes argumentative texts following a rhetorical strategy. We do not tackle this task immediately \"in the wild\", i.e., generating an entirely new argumentative text for a freely-chosen topic and a possibly complex strategy. Rather, we consider a \"controlled\" synthesis setting, with the goal of successively creating models that are able to deal with more complex settings later on.\nIn particular, given a pool of argumentative discourse units (ADUs), our approach generates arguments for any unseen pair of topic and stance (e.g., \"con abortion\") as well as a basic rhetorical strategy (i.e., logos-oriented vs. pathos-oriented). 1 To abstract from the arguments' topics during training, we first identify different ADU types using clustering. Our approach then learns to select unit types matching the given strategy and to arrange them according to their argumentative roles. Both steps are realized as a language model where ADUs represent words and arguments are sentences. Finally, our approach \"phrases\" an argument by predicting the best set of semantically related ADUs for the arranged structure using supervised regression. Thereby, we ensure that the synthesized texts are composed of meaningful units, a property that neural generation methods barely achieve so far.\nIn our evaluation, we utilize the dataset of Wachsmuth et al. (2018). This dataset contains 260 argumentative texts on 10 topic-stance pairs, where each text composes five ADUs in a logos-oriented or pathos-oriented manner. In our experiments, we train our approach on nine topic-stance pairs and then generate an argument for the tenth. The results demonstrate that our approach successfully manages to combine pairs of ADUs, but its performance on longer sequences of ADUs is limited.\nAltogether, our contribution is three-fold:\n1. A new view of argumentation synthesis that represents argumentative and rhetorical considerations with language modeling.\n2. A novel approach that selects, arranges, and phrases ADUs to synthesize strategy-specific arguments for any topic and stance.\n3. First experimental evidence that arguments with basic rhetorical strategies can be synthesized computationally. 2", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Recently, some researchers have tackled argumentation synthesis statistically with neural networks. For instance, Wang and Ling (2016) employed a sequence-to-sequence model to generate summaries of argumentative texts, and Hua and Wang (2018) did similar to generate counterarguments. Using neural methods in text generation, it is possible to achieve output that is on topic and grammatically (more or less) correct. However, when the desired text is to span multiple sentences, the generated text regularly suffers from incoherence and repetitiveness, as for instance discussed by Holtzman et al. (2018) who examine texts that were produced by RNNs in various domains. While these problems may be tolerable to some extent in some applications, such as chatbots, bad text cannot be accepted in an argumentative or debating scenario, where the goal is to convince or persuade a reader (rather than to merely inform or entertain). Holtzman et al. (2018) propose to alleviate incoherence and repetitiveness by training a set of discriminators, which aim to ensure that a text respects the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner (Grice, 1975). To this end, they employ specific datasets, such as one that opposes authentic text continuation to randomly-sampled text. The discriminators learn optimal weightings for the various models and their combination, such that overall text quality is maximized. For argumentation, we hypothesize that one needs to go even further and eventually account for the author, implementing her underlying intention in the different parts of an argumentative text as well as in the relations between the parts.\nIn the past times of rule-based text generation, argumentation synthesis was a popular task (Zukerman et al., 2000). Approaches involved much handcrafted (linguistic and domain) knowledge and user modeling. For example, the system of Carenini and Moore (2006) compares attributes of houses (from a database) to desired target attributes (from a user model), to then recommend a house to the reader in a convincing text following the Gricean maxims. To this end, it selected house attributes potentially interesting to the user, arranged, and finally phrased them. The resulting texts resembled the arguments we work with here, which have been manually composed by experts (Wachsmuth et al., 2018) from the claims, evidence, and objections in the arg-microtext corpus (Peldszus and Stede, 2016). To achieve a similar level of output control, today's text-to-text generation models need to account for the various interdependencies between the text units to be combined.\nMost related to our approach is the system of , where a user can enter a claimlike topic along with a stance. The system then generates argumentative paragraphs on specific aspects of the topic by selecting sentences from 10 million news texts of the Gigaword corpus. Potentially relevant aspects are those that trigger evaluative judgment in the reader. The sentences are arranged so that the text starts with a claim sentence and is followed by support sentences, employing the approach of . The support sentences are ordered by maximizing the semantic connectivity between sentences. Finally, some rephrasing is done in terms of certain aspects of surface realization. In a manual evaluation, however, no text was seen as sounding natural, underlining the difficulty of the task. In contrast to , we learn directly from input data what argumentative discourse units to combine and how to arrange them. We leave surface realization aside to keep the focus on the argument composition.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Role ID Argumentative Discourse Unit", "text": "Thesis t1 German universities should on no account charge tuition fees t2 the universities in Germany should not under any circumstances charge tuition fees t3 tuition fees should not generally be charged by universities t4 universities should not charge tuition fees in Germany Con c1 one could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped c2 those who study later decide this early on, anyway c3 to oblige non-academics to finance others' degrees through taxes is not just c4 unfortunately sponsoring can lead to disagreeable dependencies in some cases Pro p1 education and training are fundamental rights which the state, the society must provide p2 education must not be a question of money in a wealthy society such as Germany p3 fees result in longer durations of studies p4 funding-wise it ought to be considered how costs incurred by students from other (federal) states can be reimbursed p5 if a university lacks the funds, sponsors must be found p6 longer durations of studies are costly p7 studying and taking higher degrees must remain a basic right for everyone p8 there are other instruments to motivate tighter discipline while studying p9 this would impede or prevent access to those who are financially weaker p10 this would mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place p11 universities are for all citizens, independent of their finances p12 what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn't actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment Topic Should all universities in Germany charge tuition fees?

Now, for each of the strategies, we map each manually-generated sequence of ADUs to a sequence of cluster labels.

A logos-oriented argument (t 4 , c 3 , p 9 , p 5 , p 8 ) and a pathos-oriented argument (p 2 , c 1 , p 7 , p 6 , t 2 ). The thesis of each argument is marked bold.\nand by the baseline, with and without considering the ordering of ADUs. Our models outperform the baseline for 1-grams and 2-grams in all cases. For sequential 3-grams, however, it did not achieve any overlap with the human-generated arguments for either strategy. This may be explained by the fact that the employed selection and phrasing models are based on 2-grams only. For n \u2265 2, the synthesis generally does not work well anymore. We believe that the small data size is a main cause behind this, although it may also point to the limitation of composing ADUs based on surface features. In the non-sequential case, though, our model performs comparably well for 3-grams, and it even manages to correctly synthesize some ADU 4-grams.\nIn Table 6, we exemplify the top-scored arguments for one topic-stance pair, synthesized by our approach for logos and for pathos respectively. They indicate that our model was able to learn strategy-specific differences. 6 In particular, the logos argument starts with the thesis (t 2 ), as argumentation guidelines suggest. It then reasons based on consequences and alternatives. Matching intu-ition, the pathos argument appeals more to emotion, reflected in phrases such as \"wealthy society\" and \"under any circumstances\". Particularly the thesis (t 4 ) has a more intense tonality than t 2 , and putting it at the end creates additional emphasis.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper has presented a topic-independent computational approach to imitate the process of selecting, arranging, and phrasing argumentative discourse units (ADUs) -so to speak, to synthesize arguments. We have proposed to operationalize the necessary synthesis knowledge in the form of a combined language and regression model that predicts ADU sequences. So far, we have evaluated our approach on a small dataset only that contains 260 argumentative texts following either of two rhetorical strategies. For a controlled experiment setting based on this data, we have reported preliminary results of medium effectiveness regarding the imitation of human-generated arguments.\nA big challenge for the future is to move from such a controlled setting to a real-world scenario, where arguments have to be formed for a freelychosen topic from material that is mined from the web. Still, our topic-independent approach defines a first substantial step in this direction.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse (George A.
