In speech, a model pre-trained by self-supervised learning transfers remarkably well on multiple tasks. However, the lack of a consistent evaluation methodology is limiting towards a holistic understanding of the efficacy of such models. SUPERB was a step towards introducing a common benchmark to evaluate pretrained models across various speech tasks. In this paper, we introduce SUPERB-SG, a new benchmark focused on evaluating the semantic and generative capabilities of pre-trained models by increasing task diversity and difficulty over SUPERB. We use a lightweight methodology to test the robustness of representations learned by pre-trained models under shifts in data domain and quality across different types of tasks. It entails freezing pretrained model parameters, only using simple task-specific trainable heads. The goal is to be inclusive of all researchers, and encourage efficient use of computational resources. We also show that the task diversity of SUPERB-SG coupled with limited task supervision is an effective recipe for evaluating the generalizability of model representation.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is the main driver of this paradigm, an effective and scalable way to learn high-level representation of language that transfers to a variety of tasks. SSL entails learning from the input or some perturbation of it without the need for labelled data. This has unlocked the usage of large amounts of cheaply available unlabelled data. It lends naturally to neural network models that have been shown to possess impressive scaling characteristics such that it is often enough to increase the model and data sizes to improve downstream performance (Hestness et al., 2017;Jozefowicz et al., 2016;Mahajan et al., 2018;Radford et al., 2019).\nSpeech signal consists of acoustic, linguistic, prosodic, and speaker characteristics. SSL algo-rithms in speech must be evaluated in their ability to produce representations that are useful for tasks that demand understanding of linguistic, speaker, and prosodic elements of spoken language as well as high-level semantics. Researchers have used auto-regressive, contrastive, discriminative and multi-task learning objectives to pre-train models, and have investigated their capabilities across tasks like phoneme recognition (van den Oord et al., 2018;Chung et al., 2019), automatic speech recognition (ASR) (Liu et al., 2020b;Schneider et al., 2019;Ravanelli et al., 2020;Hsu et al., 2021;Chang et al., 2021), speaker verification (Fan et al., 2020), speaker identification (Chung et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020c), emotion recognition (Macary et al., 2021), speech translation (Chung et al., 2019), voice conversion (Lin et al., 2020;Huang et al., 2021a), spoken language understanding (Lai et al., 2021), and text-tospeech (\u00c1lvarez et al., 2019). However, the methodologies in such studies vary in the use of datasets, fine-tuning strategies and task-specific model architectures. To bridge this gap, SUPERB (Yang et al., 2021) introduced a standardized benchmark of 10 speech tasks to compare 13 pre-trained models and a Log Mel-Filterbank baseline. It studied the models' performance in tasks focusing on linguistic (phoneme recognition and automatic speech recognition, keyword spotting and query by example), shallow semantic (intent classification and slot filling), speaker (speaker identification, speaker verification and speaker diarization), and prosodic (emotion recognition) characteristics.\nIn this paper, we introduce SUPERB-SG, a benchmark with 5 new tasks, which are speech translation, out-of-domain ASR, voice conversion, speech separation, and speech enhancement, with an emphasis on evaluating the semantic and generative capabilities of pre-trained models that require high-level representations to capture linguistic, semantic, and speaker characteristics. These tasks go beyond speech recognition by focusing on various other aspects that are essential to building intelligent speech interfaces. Further, we show that while SSL models achieve close to state-of-the-art performance on many tasks, there isn't one model that outperforms all others, and that a simple Log Mel-Filterbank can perform competitively on some tasks. We also demonstrate the robustness of our methodology with an ablation study over different task-specific model architectures and data sizes.", "n_publication_ref": 35, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Downstream Model", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Downstream", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Features 1", "text": "Upstream Model (eg.

Although the tasks in SUPERB span across different domains, most of them are simple classification problems, or only require utilization of shallow semantics. In contrast, we focus on harder semantic and generative tasks.\nAnother recently proposed benchmark is the LeBenchmark (Evain et al., 2021), investigating the performance of SSL models trained on French data with three semantic tasks.

The OOD-ASR tasks are categorized into cross-lingual and spontaneous speech tasks. For the cross-lingual tasks, we choose the Mexican Spanish (es), Mandarin (zh), and Arabic (ar) subsets from Common Voice 7.0 (Ardila et al., 2020) (CC0 Licensed) containing 21.5, 31.2, and 30.7 hours of training data respectively.

We use the commonly used mel-cepstrum distortion (MCD), word error rate (WER) and automatic speaker verification (ASV) accept rate from off-the-shelf ASR and ASV models as evaluation metrics. The downstream model is trained to reconstruct the acoustic feature from the upstream representations in a target-speaker-dependent manner. In the conversion phase, given the representations extracted by the upstream, the model generates the converted acoustic features, which are then sent to a neural vocoder to synthesize the converted waveform.

In speech generation tasks (VC, SS, and SE), FBANK yields comparable or superior performance than some SSL models, especially for those metrics that take the quality of the output signal into account. For VC, the 3 reported metrics have the same trend for respective models. Here, vq-wav2vec achieves the best performance on MCD and ASV, while HuBERT performs the best on WER. For SS, Hubert-Large achieves the best performance, followed by Modified CPC. PASE+, which is pre-trained with denoising tasks, performs better than half the SSL models, but this observation doesn't transfer to the other tasks. For SE, all upstream models perform comparably.

However, HuBERT-Large performs most competitively on all downstream tasks, especially those requiring linguistic and semantic signals.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Correlation between tasks", "text": "We analyze the correlations between tasks in SUPERB-SG to understand the similarity between tasks, and verify if the experimental results agree with the common understanding of related tasks based on shared representation they require.\nTo compute the correlation, we first change all metrics into a higher-better manner. Then, we compute the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (Spearman's \u03c1) between all pairs of tasks. For multiple metrics contained in a single task, such as MCD/WER/ASV in VC as well as PESQ/STOI in SE, we compute each of them separately.\nTo make our analysis more representative and generalized to all speech domains, we bring back the six tasks from SUPERB (Yang et al., 2021) that are considered representative of the following four domains: (i) Content recognition tasks contain-   ing Phoneme Recognition (PR), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) (ii) Speaker identity tasks including Identification (SID), Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) (iii) Semantics task which is Intent Classification (IC) and (iv) Prosodic task which is Emotion Recognition (ER). Together with the 5 tasks introduced in this paper, we show the results of total 11 downstream tasks with the 14 corresponding metrics in Figure 2.\nOverall, results show that all tasks except SS and SE have strong positive correlation among them. One possible explanation for SS and SE not showing strong correlation is that the low-level information closely related to audio signals is more critical as they need to reconstruct clean speech from interfering speakers and background noise by estimating the STFT masks. As a result, high-level information extracted from SSL models has little benefit for these tasks but is helpful for other tasks. As noted earlier, there is only a small gap in performance between FBANK and SSL models. If we leave SS and SE out, all correlation coefficients are greater than 0.58, showing that the SSL model representations are useful for multiple domains.\nAlthough the Spearman's \u03c1 are large in general in Figure 2, differences between tasks are observable. Here, we focus on the relation between correlation and similarity of tasks. We list the most and the least two correlated tasks comparing with ST, OOD-ASR, VC, SS, and SE. SS and SE are skipped as candidates for for the least correlated   tasks since they dominate the results. For VC, we average the correlation coefficients across the three metrics. The results are shown in Table 3. ST and OOD-ASR are highly correlated with ASR since they both transform speech signals into discrete text tokens. IC is also correlated with ST since semantic information is required to perform both tasks. Moreover, ASV and VC are the least correlated tasks since they primarily focus on the speaker information with lesser regard to the semantic content. However, the absolute correlation values are still larger than 0.7. For VC, the speaker information needs to be removed while the content has to be kept, similar to PR and ASR but different from SID. SS and SE are correlated with each other and have a much lower correlation with speaker identity and semantics tasks, supporting our assumption. Overall, we find that empirically highly-correlated tasks require similar knowledge or understanding ability.\nTo give a broader view of our correlation results, we further cluster the downstream tasks by their correlation with each other using K-means. In this way, all the tasks are considered simultaneously, and the grouping is driven automatically by the empirical correlation results. If more than one metric are used in a downstream task, we cluster them independently. The clustering results are shown in Table 4 and a rearranged correlation map is shown in Figure 3. The result shows that the clusters of the tasks align with our empirical knowledge. Cluster A includes tasks that require content information, while tasks in cluster B are more sensitive to speaker and prosodic features. Cluster C contains metrics MCD and ASV of VC, which are used to evaluate the signal quality and the rates of speaker transfer. It is worth noting that WER in VC belongs to cluster A, showing that it is more similar to content-related tasks. Furthermore, clusters D, E, and F each contain one of the metrics in SS and SE, aligning with our assumption that these tasks utilize different types of information compared to other tasks.\nWith the analysis of the correlation between tasks, we empirically confirm the reliability of the results, and show that we increase the heterogeneity among speech tasks over SUPERB.

When that is further reduced to 5%, there is a change in ranking in SS due to a performance drop in Modified CPC. Excluding Modified CPC, the ranking is still fixed showing that the relative performance of the upstream models is agnostic to data size. Furthermore, when using only 1% of training data, most of the SSL models fail on the 3 downstream tasks. This phenomenon is caused by insufficient task-specific knowledge due to limited training data size.
