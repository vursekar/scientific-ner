Given the word representations, analogy questions can be automatically solved via vector computation, e.g. \"apples -apple + car \u2248 cars\" for morphological regularities and \"kingman + woman \u2248 queen\" for semantic regularities (Mikolov et al., 2013). Analogical reasoning has become a reliable evaluation method for word embeddings. In addition, It can be used in inducing morphological transformations (Soricut and Och, 2015), detecting semantic relations (Herdagdelen and Baroni, 2009), and translating unknown words (Langlais and Patry, 2007).\nIt is well known that linguistic regularities vary a lot among different languages. For example, Chinese is a typical analytic language which lacks inflection. Figure 1 shows that function words and reduplication are used to denote grammatical and semantic information. In addition, many semantic \u2020 Corresponding author. relations are closely related with social and cultural factors, e.g. in Chinese \"sh\u012b-xi\u0101n\" (god of poetry) refers to the poet Li-bai and \"sh\u012b-sh\u00e8ng\" (saint of poetry) refers to the poet Du-fu.\nHowever, few attempts have been made in Chinese analogical reasoning. The only Chinese analogy dataset is translated from part of an English dataset (Chen et al., 2015) (denote as CA_translated). Although it has been widely used in evaluation of word embeddings (Yang and Sun, 2015;Yin et al., 2016;Su and Lee, 2017), it could not serve as a reliable benchmark since it includes only 134 unique Chinese words in three semantic relations (capital, state, and family), and morphological knowledge is not even considered.\nTherefore, we would like to investigate linguistic regularities beneath Chinese. By modeling them as an analogical reasoning task, we could further examine the effects of vector offset methods in detecting Chinese morphological and semantic relations. As far as we know, this is the first study focusing on Chinese analogical reasoning. Moreover, we release a standard benchmark for evaluation of Chinese word embedding, together with 36 open-source pre-trained embeddings at GitHub 1 , which could serve as a solid basis for Chinese NLP tasks.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Morphological Relations", "text": "Morphology concerns the internal structure of words. There is a common belief that Chinese is a morphologically impoverished language since a morpheme mostly corresponds to an orthographic character, and it lacks apparent distinctions between roots and affixes. However, Packard (2000) suggests that Chinese has a different morphological system because it selects different \"settings\" on parameters shared by all languages. We will clarify this special system by mapping its morphological analogies into two processes: reduplication and semi-affixation.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Reduplication", "text": "Reduplication means a morpheme is repeated to form a new word, which is semantically and/or syntactically distinct from the original morpheme, e.g. the word \"ti\u0101n-ti\u0101n\"(day day) in Figure 1(b) means \"everyday\". By analyzing all the word categories in Chinese, we find that nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and measure words have reduplication abilities. Given distinct morphemes A and B, we summarize 6 repetition patterns in Figure 2. Each pattern may have one or more morphological functions. Taking Pattern 1 (A\u2192AA) as an example, noun morphemes could form kinship terms or yield every/each meaning. For verbs, it signals doing something a little bit or things happen briefly.

Chinese is a typical isolating language that has few affixes. Liu et al. (2001) points out that although affixes are rare in Chinese, there are some components behaving like affixes and can also be used as independent lexemes. They are called semi-affixes.\nTo model the semi-affixation process, we uncover 21 semi-prefixes and 41 semi-suffixes. These semi-suffixes can be used to denote changes of meaning or part of speech. For example, the semi-prefix \"d\u00ec-\" could be added to numerals to form ordinal numbers, and the semi-suffix \"-zi\" is able to nominalize an adjective:\n\u2022 y\u012b(one) \u2192 d\u00ec-y\u012b(first) \u00e8r(two) \u2192 d\u00ec-\u00e8r(second) \u2022 p\u00e0ng(fat) \u2192 p\u00e0ng-zi(a fat man) sh\u00f2u(thin) \u2192 sh\u00f2u-zi(a thin man)", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Semantic Relations", "text": "To investigate semantic knowledge reasoning, we present 28 semantic relations in four aspects: geography, history, nature, and people.

For example, a Chinese province may have its own abbreviation, capital city, and representative drama, which could form rich semantic analogies:\n\u2022\u0101n-hu\u012b vs zh\u00e8-ji\u0101ng (province)\n\u2022 w\u01cen vs zh\u00e8 (abbreviation)\n\u2022 h\u00e9-f\u00e9i vs h\u00e1ng-zh\u014du (capital) \u2022 hu\u00e1ng-m\u00e9i-x\u00ec vs yu\u00e8-j\u00f9 (drama)\nWe also address novel relations that could be used for other languages, e.g. scientists and their findings, companies and their founders.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Task of Chinese Analogical Reasoning", "text": "Analogical reasoning task is to retrieve the answer of the question \"a is to b as c is to ?\".

SGNS (skipgram model with negative sampling) (Mikolov et al., 2013) and PPMI (Positive Pointwise Mutual Information) (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a) are respectively typical methods for learning dense and sparse word vectors. Table 4 lists the performance of them on CA_translated and CA8 datasets under different configurations.\nWe can observe that on CA8 dataset, SGNS representations perform better in analogical reasoning of morphological relations and PPMI representations show great advantages in semantic relations. This result is consistent with performance of English dense and sparse vectors on MSR (morphology-only), SemEval (semanticonly), and Google (mixed) analogy datasets (Levy and Goldberg, 2014b;Levy et al., 2015 966 .603 .117 .162 .181 .389 .222 .414 .345 .236 .223 .327 word+ngram .715 .977 .640 .143 .184 .197 .429 .250 .449 .308 .276 .310 .368 word+char .676 .966 .548 .358 .540 .326 .612 .455 .468 .226 .296 .305 .368 PPMI word .925 .920 .548 .103 .139 .138 .464 .226 .627 .501 .300 .515 .522 word+ngram .943 .960 .658 .102 .129 .168 .456 .230 .680 .535 .371 .626 .586 word+char .913 .886 .614 .106 .190 .173 .505 .260 .638 .502 .288 .515 .524  probably because the reasoning on morphological relations relies more on common words in context, and the training procedure of SGNS favors frequent word pairs. Meanwhile, PPMI model is more sensitive to infrequent and specific word pairs, which are beneficial to semantic relations.\nThe above observation shows that CA8 is a reliable benchmark for studying the effects of dense and sparse vectors.

Specifically, we use word bigrams for ngram features, character unigrams and bigrams for character features.\nNgrams and Chinese characters are effective features in training word representations (Zhao et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2015;Bojanowski et al., 2016). However, Table 4 shows that there is only a slight increase on CA_translated dataset with ngram features, and the accuracies in most cases decrease after integrating character features. In contrast, on CA8 dataset, the introduction of ngram and character features brings significant and consistent improvements on almost all the categories. Furthermore, character features are especially advantageous for reasoning of morphological relations. SGNS model integrating with character features even doubles the accuracy in morphological questions.\nBesides, the representations achieve surprisingly high accuracies in some categories of CA_translated, which means that there is little room for further improvement. However it is much harder for representation methods to achieve high accuracies on CA8.

Also, the domain of a corpus plays an important role in the experiments. We can observe that vectors trained on news data are beneficial to geography relations, especially on People's Daily which has a focus on political news. Another example is Zhihu QA, an online questionanswering corpus which contains more informal data than others. It is helpful to reduplication relations since many reduplication words appear frequently in spoken language. With the largest size and varied domains, \"Combination\" corpus performs much better than others in both morphological and semantic relations.\nBased on the above experiments, we find that vector representations, context features, and corpora all have important influences on Chinese analogical reasoning.
