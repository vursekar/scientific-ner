More recently, haikus have been used by Ventura (2016) as the testbed for a thought experiment on levels of computational creativity. As we will discuss below, the classic haiku traditionally formed the starting verse of a longer poetry jam, resulting in a poem called a renga. A computational exploration of renga writing allows us to return to some of the classical ideas in Japanese poetry via thoroughly modern ideas like concept blending and collaborative AI.\nVentura's creative levels range from randomisation to plagiarisation, memorisation, generalisation, filtration, inception 1 and creation. Further gradations and criteria could be advanced, for example, the fitness function used for filtration could be developed and refined as the system learns. Creativity might be assessed in a social context, as we investigate how a system collaborates.\nWhile self-play was a good way for the recently developed board game-playing system AlphaGo to transcend its training data (Silver et al., 2016), we do not yet have computationally robust qualitative evaluation measures for the poetry domain, where there is no obvious \"winning condition.\" We began by creating a program for generating haikus, trained on a small corpus. Our technical aim then was to simulate the collaborative creation of renga, i.e., linked haikus. There are several forms of renga with varying constraints (Carley, 2015), for example the 20 stanza \"Nijiun\" renga which alternates between twoline and three-line verses, with a focus on seasonal symbolism and rules against repetition. 2 Our initial effort was a technical success, however the rengas we produced fail to fully satisfy classical constraints. A subsequent experiment is more convincing in this regard, but still leaves room for improvement. Our discussion considers the aesthetics of the generated poems and outlines directions for future research.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "Coleridge considered poetry to be \"the blossom and the fragrance of all human knowledge.\" AI researcher Ruli Manurung defines poetry somewhat more drily: \"A poem is a natural language artefact which simultaneously fulfils the properties of meaningfulness, grammaticality and poeticness\" (Manurung, 2004, p. 8).\nThe haiku as we know it was originally called hokku -\u767a\u53e5, literally the \"starting verse\" of a collaboratively written poem, hakai no renga. Typically each of following links in a renga take the familiar 5/7/5 syllable form. Classical rengas vary in length from two to 100 links (and, rarely, even 1000). The starting verse is traditionally comprised of two images, with a kireji -a sharp cut -between them. The term haiku introduced by the 19th Century poet Masaoka Shiki supersedes the older term. Stylistically, a haiku captures a moment.\nIn classical renga, all of the verses after the first have additional complex constraints, such as requiring certain images to be used at certain points, but disallowing repetition, with various proximity constraints. The setting in which rengas were composed is also worth commenting on. A few poets would compose together in party atmosphere, with one honoured guest proposing the starting haiku, then the next responding, and continuing in turn, subject to the oversight of a scribe and a renga master. These poetry parties were once so popular and time consuming that they were viewed as a major decadence. Jin'Ichi et al. (1975) offers a useful overview.\nBecause of the way we've constructed our haiku generating system, it can take an entire haiku as its input topic -we just add the word vectors to make a topic model -and compose a response. This affords AI-to-AI collaboration, or AI-human collaboration. It can also blend two inputs -for example, the previous haiku and the current constraint from the renga ruleset (e.g., the requirement to allude to \"cherry blossoms\" or \"the moon\").", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Implementation", "text": "Working with a small haiku corpus, we used a POS tagger to reveal the grammatical structure typical to haikus. The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary is used to count syllables of words that fill in this structure. 3 The Brown corpus was used to generate n-grams, and the generation process prefers more common constructions in haikus. 4 Wikipedia data was processed with GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) to create a semantic vector space model of topics, based on word co-occurrences. 5 Adding a web API turned the haiku generating system into a haiku server, and facilitated subsequent work with FloWr. In short: (1) whether a given haiku makes sense and how well it fits the topic, (2) whether it fits the form, i.e., is it a valid haiku?, and (3), the beauty of the writing, the emotion it evokes. Details of a surveybased blind comparison of human and computerwritten haikus were written up by Aji (2015). The system was then extended with multiple inputs, in some cases producing interesting blends: e.g., the following in response to \"frog pond\" and \"moon\":\nthat gull in the dressvivacious in statue from so many ebbs II. Generation of rengas Here are two rengas generated by wrapping the haiku API inside the FloWr flowchart system (Charnley et al., 2016 In each case, the prompt for the first link is \"flower blossom\" and each link is passed on to the next link along with a secondary prompt. The secondary links are \"moon,\" \"autumn,\" and \"love,\" respectively. For the first renga, we designed a flowchart that selects the \"most positive\" haiku from the ten that the haiku API returns, using the AFINN word list. 6 In the second renga, we designed a flowchart to select the haiku with the lowest word variety (computed in terms of Levenshtein distance). We made improvements to the use of the Brown corpus to utilise n-grams for word-flow and sense, as well as tuning the weightings given to sense and topic. We implemented the injection of topics via by blending, as per classical constraints (e.g., required seasonal themes like \"winter,\" or \"flowers\" in the penultimate link). At left, we quote the closing links of the first Nijiun renga generated by our software.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "III. Tuning the parameters for the Nijiun form", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion and Related Work", "text": "Towards automated evaluation Some aspects of the evaluation dimensions are built into the way the poems are constructed. Form: the haiku-generating subsystem guarantees that the requirements of a grammatical skeleton are met, and the 5/7/5 syllable pattern is guaranteed (up to the accuracy of the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary). Surface form scales up well for rengas.\nSense: the haiku generating subsystem uses an ngram model of text likelihood, which will yield a higher score for constructions that match frequently observed phrases. In our first round of experiments with rengas, sense tended to degrade quickly. Our subsequent adaptations to the renga generation algorithm prioritise greater continuitity between links.\nTopic: we used a vector model of the topic word(s), and can measure the distance to the vector given by the sum of the words in the poem.\nEmotion: In our experiment with FloWr, we used a quite simple method, filtering a list for the \"most positive\" haikus. Mohammad (2016) surveys more recent work in NLP on modelling emotion, which could be exploited in future work.\nBeauty: Waugh (1980) points out that language is based on a \"hierarchy of signs . . . of ascending complexity, but also one of ascending freedom or creativity,\" and also remarks that a \"poem provides its own 'universe of discourse.'\" To some extent these criteria pull in opposite directions: towards complexity, and towards coherence, respectively. Our first rengas could not be reasonably described as a 'universe of discourse' but rather, a 'universe of random nonsense'. This is improved in the subsequent experiment. Traditional rengas forbid repetition, and discourage overt reflection on themes like death, war, illness, impermanence, religion and sex (Carley, 2015). Thus, despite being coherent, the repetitive \"military\" theme in the final example above is not appropriate to classical constraints. A reader may identify some fortuitous resonances, e.g., \"the flower war\" is interesting within the \"afghan\" context established in earlier links -but the system itself does not yet recognise these features. Some paths forward Wiggins and Forth (2015) use hierarchical models in a system that builds a formative evaluation as it composes or reads sentences, judging how well they match learned patterns. While this seems to have more to do with constraints around typicality, per Waugh, there is room for creativity within hierarchies. Hoey (2005) makes a convincing argument that satisfying lexical constraints while violating some familiar patterns may come across as interesting and creative.\nWord similarities can be found using GloVe: this would presumably produce links with more coherent meanings, compared to the edit distance-based measure we used. Ali Javaheri Javid et al. (2016) use information gain to model the aesthetics of cellular automata. Can these ideas be combined to model evolving topic salience, complexity, and coherence?\nIf the system provided a razo (the troubadours' jargon for \"rationale\"; see Agamben (1999, p. 79)), we could debug that, and perhaps involve additional AI systems in the process (Corneli et al., 2015).", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In terms of Ventura's hierarchy of creative levels, the haiku system appears to be in the \"generalisation\" stage. Our renga-writing experiments with FloWr brought in a \"filtration\" aspect. The research themes discussed above point to directions for future work in pursuit of the \"inception\" and \"creativity\" stages.\nSome previous work with haiku, e.g. Netzer et al. (2009) and Rzepka and Araki (2015), have addressed the problem of meaning. The renga form brings these issues to the fore. We hope this early work has motivated further interest in this challenging and enjoyable poetic form that -like other less constrained forms of dialogue -combines themes of natural language generation and understanding. One natural next step would be a series of experiments in collaborative human-AI generation of rengas.
